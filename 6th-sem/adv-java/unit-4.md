### **1.4 : Building Blocks of Android**

> PYQ: Explain building blocks and architecture of Android. (2021, 2022, 2024, 15 marks)

Android applications are built using four main components, which are the building blocks of any Android app. These components can work independently or together to create a complete application.

**1. Activities:**
   - Single screen with a user interface
   - Each Activity is independent but can communicate with others
   - Follows a specific lifecycle (onCreate, onStart, onResume, etc.)

**2. Services:**
   - Components that run in the background without UI
   - Types: Started Services and Bound Services

**3. Broadcast Receivers:**
   - Respond to system-wide broadcast announcements
   - Allow applications to respond to events even when not running

**4. Content Providers:**
   - Manage structured sets of application data
   - Present data to applications as tables


**How Components Work Together:**

```
┌───────────┐     Intents     ┌───────────┐
│ Activity  │◄────────────────┤ Activity  │
└─────┬─────┘                 └─────▲─────┘
      │ Intents                     │ Intents
┌─────▼─────┐     Queries    ┌──────┴────┐
│  Service  │◄──────────────►│  Content  │
└─────┬─────┘                │ Provider  │
      │  Broadcasts          └───────────┘
┌─────▼─────┐
│ Broadcast │
│ Receiver  │
└───────────┘
```

**Additional Building Blocks:**
- **Intents:** Messaging objects for component communication
- **Manifest File:** XML file describing application components
- **R.java File:** Auto-generated resource reference file

> PYQ: Describe Android R.java file (2023, 2.5 marks)

The R.java file is an auto-generated file in Android that contains references to all resources in the application. It is created during the build process and provides a unique identifier for each resource, allowing developers to access them programmatically. It includes references to layouts, strings, drawables, colors, and other resources defined in the /res directory. It is important to note that developers should not modify the R.java file directly, as it is automatically generated and managed by the Android build system.

### **1.5 : Android Emulator**

An Activity represents a single screen with a user interface where users can interact. Each Activity in Android has a specific lifecycle that is managed by the Android system.

**Activity Lifecycle:**
1. **onCreate():** Called when activity is first created. Initialize essential components.
2. **onStart():** Activity becomes visible to the user.
3. **onResume():** Activity starts interacting with the user.
4. **onPause():** Another activity comes into foreground.
5. **onStop():** Activity is no longer visible.
6. **onRestart():** Activity restarts after stopping.
7. **onDestroy():** Activity is destroyed completely.

**Activity Stack:**
- Activities in Android follow a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stack structure
- When a new activity starts, it's pushed on top of the stack and takes focus
- The previous activity remains in the stack but is stopped
- When the user presses the back button, the current activity is popped from the stack

**Activity Launch Modes:**
- **Standard:** Default mode. Creates a new instance of the activity every time.
- **SingleTop:** If an instance of the activity already exists at the top of the stack, reuses it.
- **SingleTask:** Creates a new task and puts the activity at the root of the task.
- **SingleInstance:** Similar to SingleTask but the task can only contain that single activity.

#### **Intents**

Intents are messaging objects used to request actions from app components.

**Fragment Lifecycle:**
1. **onAttach():** Fragment is associated with its activity
2. **onCreate():** Fragment is created (without UI)
3. **onCreateView():** Fragment creates its UI view hierarchy
4. **onActivityCreated():** Host activity's onCreate() completed
5. **onStart():** Fragment becomes visible
6. **onResume():** Fragment is active and ready for user interaction
7. **onPause():** Fragment is no longer interacting with the user
8. **onStop():** Fragment is no longer visible
9. **onDestroyView():** View hierarchy is destroyed
10. **onDestroy():** Fragment is destroyed
11. **onDetach():** Fragment is detached from the activity

**Types of Fragments:**

## **Section 2 : Design Pattern**

### **2.1 : JAVA Design Pattern**

> PYQ: Explain the various design patterns in detail. (2024, 15 marks)

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced software developers. Design patterns provide a standardized way to solve recurring design problems, making code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.

```
┌──────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐
│   REAL WORLD     │         │   CODE WORLD     │
│                  │         │                  │
│ 🏠 House plans   │  ====>  │ 🏭 Design       │
│ 🚗 Car templates │  ====>  │    patterns     │
│ 👔 Clothing      │  ====>  │                 │
│    patterns      │         │                  │
└──────────────────┘         └──────────────────┘
```

**Benefits of Design Patterns:**
- Provide tested, proven development paradigms
- Facilitate reuse of successful designs
- Prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems
- Improve code readability for developers familiar with the patterns
- Establish a common vocabulary for discussing design solutions

**Classification of Design Patterns:**
Design patterns in Java (and in general object-oriented design) are classified into three main categories, based on their purpose and scope. These patterns are part of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns from the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.

1. **Creational Patterns:** Deal with the way of creating objects.
   - Singleton Pattern
   - Factory Method Pattern
   - Abstract Factory Pattern
   - Builder Pattern
   - Prototype Pattern

2. **Structural Patterns:** Deal with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
    - Adapter Pattern
    - Bridge Pattern
    - Composite Pattern
    - Decorator Pattern
    - Facade Pattern
    - Flyweight Pattern
    - Proxy Pattern

3. **Behavioral Patterns:** Deal with the interaction and responsibility of objects.
    - Chain of Responsibility Pattern
    - Command Pattern
    - Interpreter Pattern
    - Iterator Pattern
    - Mediator Pattern
    - Memento Pattern
    - Observer Pattern
    - State Pattern
    - Strategy Pattern
    - Template Method Pattern
    - Visitor Pattern

### **2.2 : Creational Design Patterns**

> PYQ: Write short note on: Creational Pattern, Behavioral Pattern, Structural Pattern, J2EE Pattern, Presentation Layer. (2023, 15 marks)

Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They help make the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

Creational patterns are about CLASS CREATION or OBJECT CREATION.

```
  ┌──────────┐
  │ Class    │
  │ Creation │
  └──────────┘
       │
       ▼
  ┌──────────┐
  │ Object   │
  │ Creation │
  └──────────┘
```

**Common Use Cases:** Object creation, resource management

**Common Creational Patterns:**
| Pattern              | Description                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Singleton**        | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.                                            |
| **Factory Method**   | Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. |
| **Abstract Factory** | Provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.  |
| **Builder**          | Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.                                              |
| **Prototype**        | Creates new objects by cloning an existing object.                                                                   |

### **2.3 : Structural Design Patterns**

> PYQ: Explain structural and behavioural Java design patterns. (2021, 2022, 15 marks)
> PYQ: Write short note on: Creational Pattern, Behavioral Pattern, Structural Pattern, J2EE Pattern, Presentation Layer. (2023, 15 marks)

Structural design patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that when parts of a system change, the entire system doesn't need to change.

Structural patterns are about RELATIONSHIPS between objects.
```
  ┌──────┐     ┌──────┐     ┌──────┐
  │Object│─────│Object│─────│Object│
  └──────┘     └──────┘     └──────┘
      │            │            │
    ┌─┴────────────┴────────────┴─┐
    │      Larger Structure       │
    └─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Common Use Cases:** UI components, data structures, and object composition

**Common Structural Patterns:**
| Pattern       | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adapter**   | Converts one interface to another interface that clients expect.                             |
| **Bridge**    | Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation so the two can vary independently. |
| **Composite** | Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.                   |
| **Decorator** | Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.                                                |
| **Facade**    | Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.                                         |
| **Flyweight** | Reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.               |
| **Proxy**     | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.              |

### **2.4 : Behavioral Design Patterns**

> PYQ: Explain structural and behavioural Java design patterns. (2021, 2022, 15 marks)
> PYQ: Write short note on: Creational Pattern, Behavioral Pattern, Structural Pattern, J2EE Pattern, Presentation Layer. (2023, 15 marks)

Behavioral design patterns focus on algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They characterize complex control flows that are difficult to follow at runtime and help define how objects interact and distribute responsibility.

**Common Use Cases:** Framework methods, data processing pipelines

**Common Behavioral Patterns:**
| Pattern                     | Description                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes a request along a chain of handlers.                                           |
| **Command**                 | Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting users parameterize clients.      |
| **Interpreter**             | Provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions.                           |
| **Iterator**                | Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially.            |
| **Mediator**                | Reduces communication complexity between objects.                                     |
| **Memento**                 | Captures and restores an object’s internal state.                                     |
| **Observer**                | Allows a subject to notify all observers automatically of any state changes.          |
| **State**                   | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.               |
| **Strategy**                | Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime.                                 |
| **Template Method**         | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. |
| **Visitor**                 | Allows adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying them.    |

### **2.5 : J2EE Design Patterns**

> PYQ: J2EE design pattern(s) (2021, 2022, 2.5 marks)
> PYQ: Write short note on: Creational Pattern, Behavioral Pattern, Structural Pattern, J2EE Pattern, Presentation Layer. (2023, 15 marks)

J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition) design patterns are specific patterns used in enterprise Java applications. These patterns address common challenges in developing complex enterprise systems.

These are broadly categorized into three types by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle):
1. **Presentation Tier Patterns:** Focus on the user interface and presentation logic.
2. **Business Tier Patterns:** Focus on the business logic and processing.
3. **Integration Tier Patterns:** Focus on the integration of different systems and data sources.

#### **Presentation Tier Patterns**
These patterns are used in the web layer (front-end interaction with users) to manage how data is displayed and handled in a web application.

**Common Presentation Tier Patterns:**
| Pattern                 | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intercepting Filter** | Pre/post-processing of requests and responses (e.g., authentication, logging).                    |
| **Front Controller**    | A single handler for all requests (e.g., servlet/controller that delegates requests to handlers). |
| **View Helper**         | Helps in separating business logic from UI code (e.g., using JSP tags or custom tags).            |
| **Composite View**      | Composes views from multiple subviews (e.g., reusable UI components in JSPs).                     |
| **Dispatcher View**     | A controller determines which view to render and delegates request.                               |
| **Service to Worker**   | Combines Front Controller + View Helper; controller handles navigation & helpers handle logic.    |

#### **Business Tier Patterns**
These patterns are used in the business logic layer to manage the core functionality of the application.

**Common Business Tier Patterns:**
| Pattern                       | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Business Delegate**         | Hides the complexity of EJB and provides a simple interface to the presentation tier. |
| **Session Facade**            | Provides a unified interface to a set of EJBs or business components.                 |
| **Application Service**       | Centralizes business logic into a service layer (stateless).                          |
| **Service Locator**           | Abstracts the lookup of services like EJBs, JMS, JNDI to reduce code duplication.     |
| **Transfer Object (DTO)**     | Used to transfer data between layers (serializable object carrying multiple values).  |
| **Transfer Object Assembler** | Combines multiple DTOs into a single DTO for transfer.                                |

#### **Integration Tier Patterns**
These patterns deal with data access and integration with external systems, databases, and services.
These patterns help in managing the complexity of integrating different systems and data sources.

**Common Integration Tier Patterns:**
| Pattern                      | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Access Object (DAO)** | Abstracts and encapsulates all access to the data source (DB operations).   |
| **Service Activator**        | Listens for events (e.g., JMS messages) and invokes business services.      |
| **Web Service Broker**       | Mediates between service consumers and providers using web services.        |
| **Domain Store**             | Maps objects to persistent storage and vice versa (used in ORM frameworks). |
