7. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: Converts data into electrical signals or radio waves and transmits them through antennas.

### **1.5 Wireless Local Loop (WLL)**

> PYQ: Wireless local loop (2021, 5 marks)

#### What is Wireless Local Loop?

* **WLL** is a system that connects **subscribers (users)** to the **telephone network** using **wireless** technology instead of traditional copper wires like in landline phones.
* It is mainly used to provide **telephone and internet services** in areas where it is difficult or expensive to lay cables (e.g., rural or hilly areas).

#### Components of WLL:

1. **Telephone Exchange:** The central system that connects calls between different users and routes them to the public telephone network.
2. **Base Station:** A fixed station that connects to the telephone exchange. Acts like a mini mobile tower.
3. **Subscriber Unit:** A wireless phone or terminal used by the user to make calls or access the internet.
4. **Radio Link:** The wireless connection between the base station and subscriber unit.

#### Block Diagram of WLL System

```
         Telephone Exchange
               │
       ┌───────▼────────┐
       │  Base Station  │
       │ (Wireless Hub) │
       └───────┬────────┘
               │  Radio Link (Wireless)
       ┌───────▼────────┐
       │Subscriber Unit │
       │(Wireless Phone)│
       └────────────────┘
```

#### How it Works:

1. User dials a number using their wireless phone (subscriber unit).
2. The signal is sent to the nearest **base station** using radio waves.
3. The base station forwards the call to the **telephone exchange**.
4. The exchange connects the call to the desired recipient, either within the same WLL network or to the public telephone network.
5. For internet access, the base station connects to the internet service provider (ISP) and provides data services to the subscriber unit.

#### Advantages of WLL:
* **Quick Deployment**: No need for extensive cabling, making it faster to set up.
* **Cost-Effective**: Cheaper than laying physical cables in remote areas.
* **Flexibility**: Can be used in areas where traditional landline services are not feasible.

#### Structure Components:

1. **Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)**: The traditional landline network that connects calls between different users, including those in the cellular system.
2. **Mobile Switching Center (MSC)**: The central component that manages mobile calls and data sessions. It connects calls between mobile devices and the PSTN or other mobile networks. Each MSC serves multiple base stations.
3. **Base Station (BS)**: The radio tower that communicates with mobile devices within its coverage area (cell). Each base station is responsible for a specific cell and connects to the MSC.
4. **Cell**: A geographical area covered by a base station. Each cell has its own frequency band to avoid interference with neighboring cells.
5. **Mobile Devices**: The end-user devices (like smartphones, tablets) that connect to the cellular network through the base stations.

#### How Cellular System Works:
1. **User Device Initiation**: A mobile device (like a smartphone) sends a signal to the nearest base station when a call or data request is made.
2. **Base Station Communication**: The base station receives the signal and communicates with the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) to route the call or data request.
3. **Call/Data Routing**: The MSC checks the user's location and routes the call or data to the appropriate destination, which could be another mobile device or a landline.
4. **Handover Process**: If the user moves to another cell during a call, the system performs a handover to transfer the connection to the new base station without dropping the call.
5. **Call/Data Completion**: Once the call or data session is completed, the MSC updates the user's location in its database to ensure future requests are routed correctly.

#### Cellular System Operation:
1. **Cell Division**: The coverage area is divided into smaller cells, each served by a base station.
2. **Frequency Reuse**: The same frequencies can be used in non-adjacent cells to maximize spectrum efficiency.
3. **Handover**: When a user moves from one cell to another, the system seamlessly transfers the call/data connection to the new base station without interruption.
4. **Interference Management**: The system manages interference between cells to ensure clear communication.
5. **Roaming**: Users can access services outside their home network by connecting to other networks, allowing for broader coverage.

#### Generations of Cellular Networks:

* **1G (First Generation)**: First generation of mobile networks, analog technology, basic voice calls only.
* **2G (GSM/Global System for Mobile Communications)**: First digital cellular system, introduced SMS and basic data services at 9.6-14.4 kbps.
* **3G (UMTS/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)**: Introduced high-speed data services (up to 2 Mbps), video calls, and better internet access with enhanced multimedia capabilities.
* **4G (LTE/Long Term Evolution)**: Offers high-speed internet (up to 100 Mbps), HD video streaming, VoLTE (Voice over LTE), and low latency for improved user experience.
* **5G (NR/New Radio)**: The latest generation, providing ultra-fast internet speeds (up to 10 Gbps), extremely low latency (1ms), massive device connectivity, and comprehensive support for IoT devices.

#### Advantages of Cellular System:
* **Efficient use of frequency** (due to reuse)
* **Supports mobility** (users can move from cell to cell)

## **Section 2. Wireless Transmission**

Wireless transmission is the process of sending data or signals through the **air using electromagnetic waves** instead of wires. It is the backbone of mobile communication, enabling devices to connect and communicate without physical connections.

### **2.1 Frequencies in Wireless Communication**

#### **What is Frequency?**
* **Frequency** refers to the number of times a signal **oscillates (vibrates)** per second.
* **Frequency** = number of wave cycles per second
* It is measured in **Hertz/Hz** (1 Hz = 1 cycle per second).
* Higher frequencies: more data capacity but shorter range
* Lower frequencies: longer range but less data capacity

#### **Key Frequency Bands**

| **Band** | **Usage** |
|----------|-----------|
| 30 kHz – 300 kHz | AM radio |
| 30 MHz – 300 MHz | FM radio, VHF TV |
| 300 MHz – 3 GHz | Mobile phones (2G–5G), Wi-Fi |
| 3 GHz – 30 GHz | 5G, satellite communication |

#### **Frequency Management**
* **Licensed bands**: Require government permission (e.g., mobile networks)
* **Unlicensed bands**: Free to use (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)
* **Frequency reuse**: Same frequency used in non-adjacent cells to maximize spectrum efficiency

### **2.2 Signals**

#### **What is a Signal?**

* A **signal** is an electrical or electromagnetic wave that carries **information** (such as voice, video, or data) from one place to another.
* In wireless communication, signals are transmitted through the air using **radio waves**.

#### **Types of Signals**

**Signals** carry information over wireless channels and can be either **analog** or **digital**.

1. **Analog Signals**
   * Continuous signals that vary over time in a smooth way.
   * Examples: Voice in a traditional phone call, analog TV.
   * Can have infinite values at any point.
   * More susceptible to noise and distortion, making them less reliable for long-distance communication.

2. **Digital Signals**
   * Represent information as sequences of **discrete values** (0s and 1s).
   * Examples: Internet data, digital TV.
   * Easier to process, more reliable, and less prone to noise.
   * Can be compressed and encrypted, making them more efficient for transmission.

#### **Key Signal Properties**

1. **Amplitude (A)**
   * Represents the strength or intensity of the signal.
   * Higher amplitude = stronger signal.

2. **Frequency (f)**
   * Refers to the number of oscillations per second.
   * Higher frequency means higher data transmission speed but shorter range.

3. **Phase (ϕ)**
   * Describes the position of a signal at any point in its cycle.
   * Important for modulating signals in communication.

4. **Wavelength (λ)**
   * The distance between two consecutive points in a wave (like two peaks).
   * Wavelength and frequency are inversely related: Higher frequency = shorter wavelength.

#### **Signal Propagation in Wireless Systems**

Signals interact with the environment during propagation through:
   * **Reflection** – Signals bounce off obstacles (buildings, walls)
   * **Refraction** – Signals bend when passing through different media
   * **Diffraction** – Signals bend around corners/obstacles
   * **Scattering** – Signals disperse in multiple directions due to small objects

#### **Noise and Distortion**
* **Noise**: Unwanted random signals that interfere with transmission (e.g., static in calls)
* **Distortion**: Signal alteration during transmission causing information inaccuracy

#### **Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)**
* Ratio of desired signal power to noise power
* Higher SNR = better communication quality with less interference

#### **Analog vs Digital Signals in Wireless Communication**

> PYQ: Modulation (2021, 5 marks)
> PYQ: Briefly explain the different types of Digital Modulation techniques. (2023, 7 marks)

#### **What is Modulation?**

* **Modulation** is the process of modifying a carrier wave (typically a high-frequency signal) to encode information from a message signal (like voice, video, or data) for transmission over a communication channel.
* The goal is to ensure that the signal can travel efficiently over long distances and be decoded accurately at the receiver's end.

![AM Modulation Diagram](https://www.physics-and-radio-electronics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/amplitudemodulation-1.png)

#### **Why is Modulation Necessary?**

3. **Reduced Noise** - Higher frequency signals are less affected by interference and noise.
4. **Antenna Efficiency** - Higher frequencies require smaller antennas, making mobile devices more practical.

#### **Types of Modulation**

There are several types of modulation based on how the carrier wave is modified:

1. **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**
   * In **AM**, the amplitude (or strength) of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the message signal.
   * **Example**: AM radio broadcasting.
   * **Drawback**: Prone to noise and interference, as noise affects the amplitude of the signal.

2. **Frequency Modulation (FM)**
   * In **FM**, the frequency of the carrier wave is varied according to the amplitude of the message signal.
   * **Example**: FM radio broadcasting.
   * **Advantage**: More resistant to noise and interference compared to AM.

3. **Phase Modulation (PM)**
   * In **PM**, the phase of the carrier wave is changed in accordance with the message signal.
   * **Example**: Used in some satellite communications.
   * **Combination**: Often combined with FM to create **Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK)** or **Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)** in digital communication.

4. **Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)**
   * **QAM** combines both **AM** and **FM** by varying both the amplitude and phase of the carrier wave. It is used for high-data-rate communication.
   * **Example**: Used in digital TV and cable modems.
   * **Advantage**: Efficient use of bandwidth and provides higher data rates.

#### **Digital Modulation Techniques**

2. **Resistance to Interference** - Less affected by narrowband interference as only small portions of the spread signal are impacted
3. **Multipath Fading Resistance** - More resilient to signal reflections that cause multipath fading
4. **Multiple Access** - Enables multiple users to share same frequency band simultaneously (used in CDMA)
5. **Robustness** - Provides better performance in noisy environments and allows for more reliable communication
6. **Reduced Jamming** - Makes it difficult for jammers to disrupt the communication as the signal is spread over a wide range

#### **How Spread Spectrum Works**
* **Spreading**: The original signal is multiplied by a pseudo-random code (spreading code) that has a much higher frequency than the original signal.
* **Transmission**: The spread signal is transmitted over a wide frequency band, making it less susceptible to interference and noise.

   * **Advantages**: High resistance to interference, better signal quality, and allows for multiple users (CDMA).
   * **Applications**: GPS, Wi-Fi (802.11b), and cellular networks.
   
3. **Time Hopping Spread Spectrum (THSS)**:
In THSS, the signal is transmitted in short bursts at random time intervals, making it difficult for unauthorized users to intercept.
   * **Advantages**: Provides security and resistance to jamming.
   * **Applications**: Used in some military applications and secure communications.

4. **Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS)**:
In CSS, the signal is modulated by a chirp signal that sweeps through a range of frequencies over time. This technique is particularly useful for long-range communication.

##### **2. Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)**

> PYQ: CSMA (2023, 2.5 marks)

**CSMA** improves upon ALOHA by listening to the channel before transmission to reduce collision probability.

**Working Principle:**
* Devices listen to detect if channel is busy before transmitting
* If channel is busy, device follows a specific protocol to determine when to try again
* Different variants implement different strategies for channel access

##### **a. CSMA/CD (Collision Detection)**

**Working Principle:**
* Listen before transmitting
* If collision detected during transmission, abort immediately
* After collision, wait random time before retrying
* Primarily used in wired networks (Ethernet)

**Advantages:**
* More efficient than ALOHA
* Quick collision resolution
* Well-suited for wired networks

**Disadvantages:**
* Difficult to implement in wireless networks
* Cannot solve hidden terminal problem
* Efficiency decreases with propagation delay

##### **b. CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)**

**Working Principle:**
* Listen before transmitting
* If channel is idle, transmit after a short waiting period
* If channel is busy, back off for a random time
* Uses techniques like RTS/CTS to address hidden terminal problem
* Used in wireless networks (Wi-Fi)

**Advantages:**
* Better suited for wireless networks than CSMA/CD

* Reduces collision probability through random backoff

**Disadvantages:**
* Higher overhead than CSMA/CD
* Increased latency due to collision avoidance mechanisms
* Performance degrades with many active users

#### CSMA/CD vs CSMA/CA Comparison
| **Feature**          | **CSMA/CD**                     | **CSMA/CA**                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Collision Detection** | Detects collisions during transmission | Avoids collisions before transmission |
| **Medium Type**     | Primarily used in wired networks | Primarily used in wireless networks |
| **Mechanism**        | Listens before transmitting, aborts on collision | Listens before transmitting, uses RTS/CTS to avoid collisions |
| **Efficiency**       | More efficient in low-latency environments | More efficient in high-latency environments |

##### **3. Inhibit Sense Multiple Access**

**Inhibit Sense Multiple Access** uses a busy tone to indicate channel status, helping prevent collisions in wireless networks.

**Working Principle:**
* Uses a separate channel for busy tone
* Receiver generates busy tone when receiving data
* Other stations monitor busy tone channel before transmission
* Helps address hidden terminal problem

**Advantages:**
* Reduces hidden terminal problem
* Simple implementation compared to RTS/CTS
* Better throughput than basic CSMA

**Disadvantages:**
* Requires separate channel for busy tone
* Exposed terminal problem still exists
* Additional hardware requirements

##### **4. Collision Avoidance Systems**

**Collision Avoidance Systems** are designed to prevent collisions before they occur, particularly in wireless networks where hidden terminals can cause significant issues. **Hidden terminal problem** occurs when two devices cannot hear each other but can both hear a third device, leading to potential collisions.      

##### **a. MACA (Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)**

**Working Principle:**
* Uses RTS/CTS (Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send) control packets
* Sender transmits RTS to receiver
* Receiver responds with CTS if ready
* Nearby nodes hearing CTS defer their transmissions
* Addresses hidden terminal problem

```
A ─── RTS ───> B ─── CTS ───> C
(Sender)       (Receiver)     (Other node)
```
*Figure 3.8: MACA operation with RTS/CTS exchange*

##### **b. MACAW (MACA for Wireless)**

**Working Principle:**
* Enhances MACA with acknowledgments (ACK)
* Improves backoff algorithm
* Adds carrier sensing before RTS
* Better sharing of medium information between nodes

```
A ─── RTS ───> B ─── CTS ───> A
A ─── DATA ──> B ─── ACK ───> A
```
*Figure 3.9: MACAW operation with RTS/CTS/DATA/ACK exchange*

**Advantages of Collision Avoidance Systems:**
* Effectively addresses hidden terminal problem
* Improves throughput in multi-node scenarios
* Reduces collisions for data packets

**Disadvantages:**
* Overhead for control packets
* Delay in initial transmission
* Exposed terminal problem still partially present

#### **3.2.2 Controlled Access Techniques**

In controlled access techniques, access to the medium is regulated by a centralized control mechanism or a distributed algorithm that ensures only one station transmits at a time.

##### **1. Polling**

**Polling** involves a central controller systematically checking each device to see if it has data to transmit.

**Working Principle:**
* Central controller polls each station in sequence
* Station transmits only when polled
* After transmission or if no data, control passes to next station
* Provides deterministic access with no collisions

│T1 ││T2 ││T3 │
└───┘└───┘└───┘

C = Controller
T = Terminal
```
*Figure 3.10: Centralized polling structure*

**Types of Polling:**
* **Roll-Call Polling**: Controller polls each terminal in sequence
* **Hub Polling**: Controller polls only active terminals
* **Token Passing**: Special token circulates; only terminal with token may transmit

**Advantages:**

* Fair allocation of bandwidth
* Predictable performance
* Works well for high loads

**Disadvantages:**
* Polling overhead
* Single point of failure (controller)
* Increased latency as network grows
* Inefficient for large networks with light traffic

##### **2. Token Passing**

**Token Passing** is a distributed control technique where a special control frame (token) circulates among nodes, with only the token holder allowed to transmit.

**Working Principle:**
* Special token frame circulates among stations in logical ring
* Station can transmit only when it holds the token
* After transmission or if no data, token passed to next station
* Self-regulating without central controller

**Advantages:**
* No central controller needed
* Guaranteed access without collisions
* Fair bandwidth allocation
* Predictable performance

**Disadvantages:**
* Token management overhead
* Lost token recovery mechanisms needed
* Adding/removing stations is complex
* Fixed latency increases with network size

##### **3. Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA)**

> PYQ: DAMA (2022, 2.5 marks)

**DAMA** dynamically allocates channel capacity to users based on their requests, optimizing resource usage.

**Working Principle:**
* Users request bandwidth from central controller when needed
* Controller allocates resources based on availability and priorities
* Resources released when transmission completes
* Particularly useful for satellite and wireless networks

**Advantages:**
* Efficient use of resources based on actual demand
* Supports varying traffic patterns
* Can implement quality of service priorities
* More efficient than fixed assignment for bursty traffic

**Disadvantages:**
* Allocation request overhead
* Initial access delay
* Complex central controller required
* Single point of failure

##### **4. Packet Reservation Multiple Access (PRMA/PKMA)**

**PRMA** combines elements of TDMA and random access protocols to efficiently handle mixed traffic types.

**Working Principle:**
* Frame structure with time slots (like TDMA)
* Contention-based access for unreserved slots (like ALOHA)
* Successful transmission in unreserved slot leads to reservation of that slot in future frames
* Reservation maintained until explicitly released

```
Frame n:      |R1|C |R3|C |R5|R6|C |C |
Frame n+1:    |R1|R2|R3|C |R5|R6|R7|C |
Frame n+2:    |R1|R2|R3|R4|R5|R6|R7|C |

R = Reserved slot (assigned to a specific user)
C = Contention slot (available for new reservations)
```
*Figure 3.11: PRMA frame structure over time*

**Advantages:**
* Efficiently handles mix of periodic and bursty traffic
* Better performance than pure TDMA for varying traffic
* Supports both constant bit rate and variable bit rate traffic
* Dynamic adaptation to changing traffic patterns

**Disadvantages:**
* Complex implementation
* Frame synchronization required
* Initial contention phase may result in collisions
* Overhead for reservation mechanism

### **4.1 Unidirectional Distribution Systems**

In unidirectional distribution systems, information is transmitted in only one direction — from the source to multiple receivers. This type of system does not allow receivers to send data back to the source. Such systems are typically used in broadcasting applications, where the goal is to transmit content to a large audience.

#### **Features of Unidirectional Systems**:

* **One-way communication**: The source (e.g., a TV station or radio station) sends out signals to all receivers (e.g., television sets or radio receivers) in the coverage area.
* **Efficiency**: Since the same signal is broadcast to all receivers, these systems are highly efficient for mass distribution of content such as news, entertainment, and information.
* **Limited interactivity**: Unidirectional systems typically do not support user interaction or feedback. Users can only receive content without sending any data back to the source.

#### **Examples**:

* **Traditional Radio and TV Broadcasting**: Signals are sent from a central transmitter and received by anyone tuned into the right frequency or channel.
* **Satellite TV/Radio**: Signals are broadcast from satellites to ground receivers, providing services like **Direct-to-Home (DTH)** TV.

#### **Advantages of Unidirectional Distribution Systems**:

* **Wide Coverage**: Broadcasting can reach a large audience over a wide area without the need for individual connections.
** **Cost-Effective**: Broadcasting to many users simultaneously reduces costs compared to point-to-point communication.
* **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and manage, as there is no need for complex routing or addressing schemes.
* **Reliability**: Digital broadcasting technologies often include error correction and redundancy, ensuring high-quality reception even in challenging conditions.
* **Scalability**: As the audience grows, the same infrastructure can be used to reach more users without significant changes.
* **Low Latency**: Broadcasting systems can deliver real-time content with minimal delay, making them suitable for live events and news.

#### **Disadvantages of Unidirectional Distribution Systems**:
* **Lack of Interactivity**: Users cannot send feedback or interact with the content in real-time, limiting engagement.
* **Limited Personalization**: Broadcasting content is typically generic and may not cater to individual user preferences.
* **Potential for Signal Loss**: In areas with poor reception, users may experience signal degradation or loss, especially in analog systems.
* **Inefficient Use of Bandwidth**: Unused bandwidth cannot be shared among users, leading to potential wastage of resources.
* **Dependence on Infrastructure**: Requires robust transmission infrastructure, which can be costly to maintain and operate.

Unidirectional distribution systems remain a fundamental part of broadcasting technologies, providing a reliable means of mass communication across various media platforms.
