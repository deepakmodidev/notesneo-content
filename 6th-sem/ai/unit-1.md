## **Section 2: Problem Solving by Search**

AI often uses **search techniques** to find solutions to complex problems. Search involves exploring all possible solutions or paths and selecting the best one. There are different types of search strategies, including **uninformed search**, **informed search**, **local search**, and **problem reduction search**.

#### Classification of Search Techniques:
1. **Uninformed Search (Blind Search)**  
   * Does not use any domain knowledge.  
   * Examples: Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS).
2. **Informed Search (Heuristic Search)**
   * Uses heuristics to guide the search.  
   * Examples: Best First Search, A\* Algorithm.
3. **Local Search (Optimization-Based Search)**
   * Focuses on improving a single solution iteratively.  
   * Example: Hill Climbing Algorithm.
4. **Problem Reduction Search**
   * Breaks down a problem into smaller sub-problems.  
   * Example: AO\* Algorithm.
5. **Population-Based Search** 
   * Uses a group of solutions to find the best one.  
   * Examples: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA).
6. **Game Playing Search**
   * Used in AI for games to find optimal moves.  
   * Examples: Minimax Algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning.

### **2.1 Uninformed Search (Blind Search)**

>PYQ: Uninformed Search (2023, 2.5 marks)    

Uninformed search algorithm (also called **blind search**) does not use any prior knowledge (non-heuristics) about the problem. It explores all possible paths blindly until they find the solution without any guidance or heuristics. These algorithms are simple and easy to implement but can be inefficient for large search spaces.

The two main uninformed search algorithms are **Depth First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth First Search (BFS)**.

#### **1. Depth First Search (DFS)**

>PYQ: What are the limitations of Depth-first search? (2024, 1 mark)    
>PYQ: Differentiate the DFS and BFS with merits and demerits. (2023, 7 marks)

DFS explores as deep as possible along one path before backtracking. It goes down one branch of the search tree until it reaches a dead end, then backtracks to explore other branches.

**Example:** Solving a maze by going in one direction until hitting a dead end, then backtracking.

##### **How DFS Works:**

1. Start from the initial node.  
2. Expand a node and visit its first child.  
3. Continue expanding the first child of each node until a dead end is reached.  
4. Backtrack to the previous node and explore the next child.  
5. Repeat until the goal is found or all paths are explored.

##### **Implementation:**

* Uses a **stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)** for storing nodes.  
* Can be implemented using recursion or an explicit stack.

##### **Example:**

For the following graph:
```
    A  
   / \  
  B   C  
 / \   \  
D   E   F
```

**`DFS traversal (starting from A):`**

`A → B → D → E → C → F`

##### **Advantages:**

* Uses less memory than BFS.  
* Works well for problems with deep solutions.

##### **Disadvantages and Limitations of DFS:**

* May get stuck in an infinite loop if cycles exist (without a proper visited nodes check).  
* Does not guarantee the shortest path - it finds *a* path, not necessarily the optimal one.
* Can be inefficient for wide search spaces - might explore deep paths that lead nowhere.
* Memory usage can grow linearly with the depth of the search tree.
* Risk of stack overflow for very deep trees when using recursion.
* May never terminate if the search space is infinite and contains no solution.

#### **2. Breadth First Search (BFS)**

>PYQ: Differentiate the DFS and BFS with merits and demerits. (2023, 7 marks)    

BFS explores all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level. It is like searching level by level, ensuring that all nodes at a given depth are explored before going deeper.

**Example:** Finding the shortest route in Google Maps by exploring all possible paths from the starting point.

##### **How BFS Works:**

1. Start from the initial node.  
2. Explore all direct children before moving to their children.  
3. Continue this process until the goal is found or all nodes are visited.

##### **Implementation:**

* Uses a **queue (FIFO - First In, First Out)** for storing nodes.

##### **Example:**

For the same graph:
```
     A  
    / \
   B   C
  / \   \
 D   E   F
```

**BFS traversal (starting from A):**  
 `A → B → C → D → E → F`

##### **Advantages:**

* Guarantees the shortest path if all steps have equal cost.  
* Avoids getting stuck in infinite loops.

##### **Disadvantages:**

* Uses more memory than DFS.  
* Can be slow if the search space is large.

##### **Comparison: DFS vs BFS**

| Feature | DFS | BFS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Structure** | Stack (LIFO) | Queue (FIFO) |
| **Exploration Style** | Goes deep first | Explores level by level |
| **Memory Usage** | Less (only stores path) | More (stores all nodes at a level) |
| **Guaranteed Shortest Path?** | No | Yes |
| **Best For** | Deep solutions | Shortest path problems |
| **Example** | Maze solving, game trees | Shortest path in graphs, web crawling |

* **Use DFS** when memory is limited or when a deep solution exists.  
* **Use BFS** when the shortest path is required.  
* Both DFS and BFS are useful for solving AI problems like maze navigation, web crawling, and pathfinding in graphs.

#### **Water Jug Problem**

Water Jug Problem is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using search algorithms. The problem involves two jugs with different capacities and the goal is to measure a specific amount of water using these jugs. This problem can be represented as a state space search problem, where each state represents the amount of water in each jug.

This can be implemented using either DFS or BFS. The search space consists of all possible states of the jugs, and the goal is to find a sequence of actions that leads to the desired state.

#### **Water Jug Problem Example** 

>PYQ: Consider a water jug problem. You are given 2 jugs; a 3-gallon jug and a 4-gallon jug. Neither has any measuring marks on it. There is a pump that can be used to fill the jugs with water. How can you get exactly 2-gallon of water into a 4-gallon jug? State the production rules for the water jug problem. (2024, 10 marks)

##### **Problem Definition:**

You have two jugs:

1. A 3-gallon jug (Jug A)  
2. A 4-gallon jug (Jug B)  

Neither jug has any measuring marks on it. You can fill the jugs from a water source, empty them, or pour water from one jug to another.

##### **Goal:**
Measure exactly 2 gallons of water in Jug B.

##### **Possible Actions:**

1. Fill Jug A from the water source.  
2. Fill Jug B from the water source.  
3. Empty Jug A.  
4. Empty Jug B.  
5. Pour water from Jug A to Jug B until Jug A is empty or Jug B is full.  
6. Pour water from Jug B to Jug A until Jug B is empty or Jug A is full.

##### **Solution Steps:**

| Step | Action | Jug A (3-gallon) | Jug B (4-gallon) | Explanation |
|------|--------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Fill Jug B | 0 | 4 | Fill the 4-gallon jug completely |
| 2 | Pour B → A | 3 | 1 | Pour until Jug A is full |
| 3 | Empty Jug A | 0 | 1 | Completely empty the 3-gallon jug |
| 4 | Pour B → A | 1 | 0 | Move the remaining water to Jug A |
| 5 | Fill Jug B | 1 | 4 | Fill the 4-gallon jug again |
| 6 | Pour B → A | 3 | 2 | Pour until Jug A is full (it can only take 2 more gallons) |
| 7 | **Goal reached!** | 3 | **2** | Jug B now contains exactly 2 gallons |

##### **Production Rules for Water Jug Problem:**

* **Rule 1:** If both jugs are empty, fill either jug from the source.
* **Rule 2:** If a jug is full, empty it.
* **Rule 3:** If one jug is full and the other is empty, pour water from the full jug to the empty jug.
* **Rule 4:** If one jug has some water and the other is empty, pour water from one jug to another until one of them is either full or empty.
* **Rule 5:** If you need a specific amount of water, check if it's possible with the current state and apply the necessary actions.

### **2.2 Informed Search (Heuristic Search)**

>PYQ: Informed Search (2022, 2.5 marks)      
>PYQ: Differentiate between informed and uninformed search. (2021, 3 marks)      
>PYQ: What do you mean by term Heuristics? (2021, 3 marks)     

Informed search (also called **heuristic search**) uses additional knowledge (heuristics) to find solutions more efficiently than uninformed search. A **heuristic function** estimates how close a given state is to the goal. 

**Meaning of Heuristics:** - Heuristics are rules of thumb or problem-specific knowledge that helps in estimating the cost or distance to the goal. They guide the search process, making it more efficient.

#### **Difference Between Informed and Uninformed Search:**
| Aspect | Informed Search | Uninformed Search |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Knowledge** | Uses heuristics to guide search | No prior knowledge, explores blindly |
| **Efficiency** | More efficient, faster convergence | Less efficient, may explore unnecessary paths |
| **Optimality** | May not guarantee optimal solution | Guarantees optimal solution (if exists) |
| **Memory Usage** | Generally uses more memory | Generally uses less memory |
| **Examples** | A\*, Best First Search | DFS, BFS |

* **Informed Search** uses heuristics to guide the search process, making it more efficient.
* **Uninformed Search** explores all possible paths without any guidance, which can be less efficient.
* **Heuristics** are problem-specific knowledge or rules of thumb that help estimate the cost or distance to the goal.

Two common informed search algorithms are **Best First Search** and **A\* Algorithm**.

#### **1. Best First Search (Heuristic Approach)**

>PYQ: Explain the Best-First-Search Procedure with example. (2023, 8 marks)

Best First Search selects the most promising node based on a heuristic function and expands it first. It uses a heuristic function *h(n)* to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal. The algorithm explores nodes based on their heuristic values, prioritizing those that seem closest to the goal.

**Example:** AI finding the best move in a game based on estimated success.

##### **How Best First Search Works:**

1. Start from the initial node.  
2. Use a heuristic function **h(n)** to evaluate each node.  
3. Select the node with the lowest heuristic value (most promising).  
4. Expand that node and repeat until the goal is found.

##### **Implementation:**

* Uses a **priority queue (min-heap)** to store nodes, sorted by their heuristic values.

##### **Example:**

Consider the following graph where the numbers represent heuristic values (estimated distance to the goal):
```
     A(10)  
    /   \  
  B(6)   C(8)  
  /  \     \  
D(3)  E(5)  F(7)
```

If **Goal = D**, the algorithm explores:   
`A → B → D` (choosing nodes with the smallest heuristic value).

##### **Advantages:**

* Faster than uninformed searches.  
* Uses heuristics to prioritize promising paths.
* Can find solutions more quickly in large search spaces.

##### **Disadvantages:**

* May not always find the optimal solution.  
* Performance depends on the accuracy of the heuristic function.
* Can be inefficient if the heuristic is not well-designed.

#### **2. A\* Algorithm**

>PYQ: Explain A* algorithm. (2022, 15 marks)    
>PYQ: Explain algorithm A* with example. (2023, 7 marks)    

A\* (**A-Star**) is an improved version of Best First Search. It combines the cost to reach a node and the estimated cost to reach the goal. A\* uses two functions:

* **g(n):** The actual cost from the start to the current node.  
* **h(n):** The estimated cost from the current node to the goal.

It combines them using the formula: 
`f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`

Where:
* **f(n):** Estimated total cost to reach the goal.  
* **g(n):** Cost from the start node to the current node.  
* **h(n):** Estimated cost from the current node to the goal.

**Example:** GPS navigation systems finding the best route to a destination.

##### **How A\* Algorithm Works:**

1. Start from the initial node.  
2. Use the formula **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)** to evaluate each node.  
3. Select and expand the node with the lowest **f(n)** value.  
4. Repeat until the goal is found.

##### **Implementation:**

* Uses a **priority queue** to store nodes, sorted by **f(n)** values.

##### **Example:**

Consider this graph where numbers represent **g(n)** (cost) and **h(n)** (heuristic values):
```
     A  
   (0,4)  
   /   \  
 B(1,2)  C(2,2)  
  |       |  
 D(3,0)   E(5,0) [Goal]
```

**A\* Calculation:**

1. **A → B**: f(B) = g(B) + h(B) = **1 + 2 = 3**  
2. **A → C**: f(C) = g(C) + h(C) = **2 + 2 = 4**  
3. Expand B (smallest f): **B → D**: f(D) = **3 + 0 = 3** (Goal reached).

##### **Advantages:**

* Guarantees the shortest path if the heuristic is admissible (does not overestimate). 
* Uses both cost and heuristic information for better performance. 
* More efficient than Best First Search.

##### **Disadvantages:**

* Can be slow if the search space is very large.  
* Requires a well-designed heuristic function for optimal performance.
* Memory-intensive due to storing all nodes in the priority queue.

##### **Comparison: Best First Search vs A\* Algorithm**

| Feature | Best First Search | A\* Algorithm |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Uses Heuristic?** | Yes (h(n)) | Yes (h(n) and g(n)) |
| **Evaluation Function** | f(n) = h(n) | f(n) = g(n) + h(n) |
| **Finds Shortest Path?** | Not always | Yes (if heuristic is good) |
| **Performance** | Fast but not optimal | Efficient and optimal |
| **Memory Usage** | Less memory | More memory (stores all nodes) |
| **Best For** | Quick solutions | Optimal pathfinding |

* **Best First Search** is faster but does not always guarantee the best solution.  
* **A\* Algorithm** is more reliable as it considers both cost and heuristics.  
* A\* is widely used in **Google Maps, robotics, and AI pathfinding in games**.

### **2.3 Local Search (Optimization-Based Search)**

Local search is a simple optimization-based search technique that focuses on improving a single solution step by step. Unlike uninformed or informed searches that explore all possible paths, local search starts with an initial solution and continuously moves toward a better solution by making small changes. 

**How it works:**
* Start with any solution
* Make small changes to try to improve it
* Keep the better solution and repeat

Local search is like climbing a hill - you keep moving upward to find the highest point, without looking at the entire landscape at once.

**Example:** An AI adjusting settings in a recommendation system to make better suggestions.

#### **Hill Climbing Algorithm**

>PYQ: Why hill climbing algorithm is called greedy local search? (2024, 1 mark)     
>PYQ: Explain Hill Climbing strategy with example. What are the problems faced while applying this strategy? (2021, 8 marks)     
>PYQ: What is Hill Climbing? Explain simple Hill Climbing. (2022, 15 marks)      

Hill Climbing is a local search algorithm that continuously moves towards the direction of increasing value (uphill) to find the optimal solution. It evaluates neighboring solutions and selects the best one, repeating this process until no better neighbors are found.

##### **Hill Climbing as a Greedy Local Search**

Hill climbing is called a **greedy local search** for two fundamental reasons:

1. **Greedy Nature:**
   * It always chooses the immediate best option available
   * It makes the locally optimal choice at each step
   * It never reconsiders previous decisions, even if they lead to suboptimal results
   * It doesn't look ahead beyond the immediate neighbors

2. **Local Focus:**
   * It only considers the current state's neighboring solutions
   * It has no global perspective of the entire search space
   * It can't "see" beyond the immediate neighbors
   * It makes decisions based only on local information

These characteristics make hill climbing efficient but also prone to getting trapped in local optima rather than finding the global optimum solution.

##### **How Hill Climbing Works:**

1. Start with an initial solution (random or predefined).  
2. Evaluate its quality using a **heuristic function**.  
3. Generate neighboring solutions by making small modifications.  
4. Select the best neighboring solution.  
   * If the new solution is better, keep it.  
   * If not, stop the search (local maximum reached). 
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until no better solution is found.

##### **Types of Hill Climbing:**

1. **Simple Hill Climbing** – Selects the first better neighbor found.  
2. **Steepest-Ascent Hill Climbing** – Examines all neighbors and chooses the best one.  
3. **Stochastic Hill Climbing** – Chooses a random better neighbor rather than the best one.

##### **Example:**

Imagine a **hiker climbing a mountain** but can only see nearby steps (local information). The hiker keeps moving up as long as the path gets higher.

##### **Problems with Hill Climbing:**

* **Local Maxima:** The algorithm may get stuck in a local maximum, where all neighbors are worse, but a better solution exists elsewhere globally.
* **Plateau:** A flat area where all neighbors have the same value, causing the algorithm to get stuck.  
* **Ridges:** A narrow path where moving in one direction decreases the value, but another path might lead to a better solution.

##### **Solutions to Overcome Problems:**

* **Random Restarts:** Run the algorithm multiple times from different starting points.  
* **Simulated Annealing:** Occasionally allow moves to worse solutions to escape local maxima.  
* **Using Memory:** Keep track of visited states to avoid loops.

##### **Advantages of Hill Climbing:**

* Uses very little memory.  
* Works well for small and continuous optimization problems.  
* Fast and efficient in finding a good solution.

##### **Disadvantages of Hill Climbing:**

* Can get stuck in local maxima or plateaus.  
* Does not always find the best solution (global maximum).

##### **Applications of Hill Climbing:**

* **AI and Game Development:** Chess move optimization.  
* **Robotics:** Path planning for robots.  
* **Machine Learning:** Neural network training optimization.  
* **Job Scheduling:** Assigning tasks to minimize execution time.

### **2.4 Problem Reduction Search: AO\* Algorithm**

>PYQ: What is the difference between A* and AO* algorithms? (2024, 5 marks)

Problem Reduction Search is a technique that breaks a large problem into smaller sub-problems, solving them step by step. The **AO\* (And-Or Star) Algorithm** is a widely used search algorithm for solving problems with multiple possible paths and dependencies. 

It is particularly useful for problems that can be represented as **AND-OR graphs**, where some sub-problems must be solved together (AND nodes) while others can be solved independently (OR nodes).
* **AND nodes:** All children must be solved together.
* **OR nodes:** Only one child needs to be solved.

**Example:** Solving a complex puzzle by breaking it down into smaller sections.

#### **Differences Between A* and AO* Algorithms**

| Aspect | A* Algorithm | AO* Algorithm |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Graph Type** | Works on regular state-space graphs | Works on AND-OR graphs (hypergraphs) |
| **Problem Solving Approach** | Finds a single path from start to goal | Solves problems that can be decomposed into subproblems |
| **Node Structure** | Single nodes representing states | Contains both OR nodes (alternative choices) and AND nodes (required subproblems) |
| **Goal** | Finding a path to a single goal state | Finding a solution tree/graph that solves the problem |
| **Evaluation Function** | f(n) = g(n) + h(n) | Similar but applies to solution subtrees |
| **Solution Type** | Linear sequence of actions | Solution graph with potential branches |
| **Decomposition** | Does not decompose problems | Decomposes complex problems into manageable subproblems |
| **Applications** | Path finding, route planning | Problem reduction, hierarchical planning, theorem proving |
| **Example Use Case** | Finding shortest path in a maze | Solving a complex puzzle by dividing it into sub-puzzles |

In essence, A* finds paths in simple graphs while AO* handles problems that can be broken down into interdependent subproblems, represented as AND-OR graphs.

#### **AO\* Algorithm**

The **AO\* Algorithm** is an extension of the A\* algorithm used for solving **AND-OR Graphs** (problems where some sub-problems must be solved together). It selects the best path by considering **both cost and heuristic information**. 

##### **Key Features of AO\***

* Works on **AND-OR graphs** instead of simple state graphs.  
* Expands nodes based on **heuristic values** (like A\*).  
* Uses **backtracking** to update costs dynamically.

##### **How AO\* Algorithm Works:**

1. **Start from the initial node** and evaluate its heuristic cost.  
2. **Expand the most promising node** based on the lowest cost.  
3. **Identify AND and OR nodes:**  
   * **OR nodes**: Only one path needs to be chosen.  
   * **AND nodes**: All children must be solved together.  
4. **Update the cost of the parent node** based on its children.  
5. **Repeat the process** until the goal state is reached.

##### **Example: Solving a Puzzle with AO\***

Consider a problem where solving **X** requires solving either **Y** or **Z**, but solving **Y** requires solving **A and B** together.

```
        X  
       / \  
     Y     Z  
    / \  
   A   B
```

* The algorithm will first estimate the cost of **A, B, and Z**.  
* If **A and B together** have a lower cost than **Z**, the algorithm will choose **Y**.  
* If **Z** is cheaper, it will choose **Z** directly.  
* The cost of **X** is updated dynamically based on the selected path.

##### **Advantages of AO\***

* Works well for hierarchical problems.  
* Finds the most cost-effective solution.  
* Dynamically updates solutions based on new information.

##### **Disadvantages of AO\***

* More complex than A\*.  
* Requires a well-defined heuristic function.

##### **Applications of AO\***

* **Automated Planning:** Task scheduling and workflow automation.  
* **Expert Systems:** Decision-making in AI-based medical diagnosis.  
* **Game Development:** Planning strategies in AI-driven games.

### **2.5 Population-Based Search**

Population-based search algorithms use a **group (population) of possible solutions** and improve them over time. These techniques are inspired by **natural processes** and are commonly used for **optimization problems**.

The two main types of population-based search algorithms are:

1. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** (inspired by ants' behavior)  
2. **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** (inspired by natural evolution)

#### **1. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**

>PYQ: Ant Colony Optimization (2022, 2.5 marks)

ACO is inspired by the way **real ants** find the shortest path to food. Ants leave **pheromones** (chemical signals) on the ground, which guide other ants to the food source. Over time, the paths with more pheromones attract more ants, leading to the discovery of the shortest path.

##### **How ACO Works:**

1. **Initialization** – A group of ants is placed at the starting point.  
2. **Path Exploration** – Each ant randomly chooses a path based on probability.  
3. **Pheromone Update** – Ants deposit pheromones on their chosen paths.  
4. **Evaporation** – Over time, pheromones on weaker paths fade.  
5. **Reinforcement** – The best path attracts more ants, strengthening its pheromone trail.  
6. **Repeat** until the best solution is found.

##### **Example:**

* **Finding the shortest route for delivery trucks.**  
* **Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).**

##### **Advantages of ACO:**

* Works well for pathfinding and optimization.  
* Adapts dynamically to changes.
* Can find multiple solutions simultaneously.

##### **Disadvantages of ACO:**

* Can take a long time to converge to the best solution.  
* Requires fine-tuning of parameters.
* Sensitive to pheromone evaporation rates.

##### **Applications of ACO:**
* **Routing Problems:** Finding optimal paths in networks (e.g., telecommunications, transportation).
* **Scheduling Problems:** Job scheduling in manufacturing and logistics.
* **Combinatorial Optimization:** Solving problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and vehicle routing.
* **Bioinformatics:** Protein folding and DNA sequencing problems.


#### **2. Genetic Algorithm (GA)**

>PYQ: Write a short note on genetic algorithms. (2021, 3 marks)      
>PYQ: Genetic Algorithm (2023, 2.5 marks)    

Genetic Algorithms are based on **natural evolution**. They simulate the process of **natural selection** where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction to produce the next generation. GA uses concepts like **mutation, crossover, and selection** to evolve solutions over generations.

##### **How GA Works:**

1. **Initialization** – Generate a random population of possible solutions.  
2. **Selection** – Pick the best solutions (parents) based on their fitness score.  
3. **Crossover (Recombination)** – Combine two parent solutions to create new solutions (children).  
4. **Mutation** – Make small random changes to the new solutions to introduce diversity.  
5. **Repeat** for multiple generations until an optimal solution is found.

##### **Encoding in Genetic Algorithms**
>PYQ: Define Encoding in Genetic algorithm. Describe the different encoding methods. (2024, 10 marks)    

Encoding is the process of representing potential solutions (individuals) in a form that can be manipulated by genetic operators. The choice of encoding is crucial for the success of a genetic algorithm.

###### **Major Types of Encoding Methods:**

1. **Binary Encoding**
   * **Representation:** Chromosomes are strings of 0s and 1s
   * **Example:** `10101101` might represent a solution
   * **Advantages:**
     * Simple to implement
     * Easy to apply genetic operators
   * **Disadvantages:**
     * May not be natural for many problems
     * May require more bits for precision
   * **Applications:** Simple parameter optimization, logical problems

2. **Value/Integer Encoding**
   * **Representation:** Chromosomes are strings of integers or decimal values
   * **Example:** `[4, 2, 7, 9, 5]` might represent a solution
   * **Advantages:**
     * More natural for many problems
     * More compact than binary
   * **Disadvantages:**
     * Requires specialized genetic operators
   * **Applications:** Resource allocation, scheduling problems

3. **Permutation Encoding**
   * **Representation:** Chromosomes are ordered sequences where each value appears exactly once
   * **Example:** `[3, 5, 1, 2, 4]` might represent an ordering/path
   * **Advantages:**
     * Natural for ordering problems
   * **Disadvantages:**
     * Requires special crossover/mutation operators to maintain validity
   * **Applications:** Traveling Salesman Problem, sequencing, scheduling

4. **Tree Encoding**
   * **Representation:** Chromosomes are tree structures
   * **Example:** Expression trees for mathematical functions
   * **Advantages:**
     * Can represent hierarchical solutions
     * Variable length representations
   * **Disadvantages:**
     * Complex genetic operators
   * **Applications:** Program evolution, symbolic regression

5. **Real-Value Encoding**
   * **Representation:** Chromosomes are vectors of floating-point numbers
   * **Example:** `[3.14, 2.71, 9.81]`
   * **Advantages:**
     * Natural for continuous optimization
     * High precision
   * **Disadvantages:**
     * Requires specialized operators
   * **Applications:** Function optimization, neural network weights

##### **Selection Methods in Genetic Algorithms**
>PYQ: Write short notes on: (i) Roulette Wheel selection (ii) Tournament selection (2024, 5 marks)    

Selection determines which individuals will become parents for the next generation. It's based on the principle that fitter individuals have a higher chance of reproduction.

###### **1. Roulette Wheel Selection**

* **How it works:**
  * Each individual gets a slice of a circular "roulette wheel"
  * The size of the slice is proportional to the individual's fitness
  * The wheel is spun and the individual where it stops is selected
  * Higher fitness = larger slice = higher chance of selection
  
* **Mathematical representation:**
  * Probability of selection = Individual's fitness / Sum of all fitness values
  
* **Example:**
  * If we have 4 individuals with fitness values [4, 2, 8, 6]:
  * Total fitness = 20
  * Selection probabilities = [20%, 10%, 40%, 30%]
  * A random number generator simulates the wheel spin
  
* **Advantages:**
  * Simple to implement
  * Selection pressure naturally adjusts with fitness distribution
  
* **Disadvantages:**
  * Can be biased if fitness differences are too high or too low.
  * Can lead to premature convergence if one solution is much fitter
  * May lose diversity quickly

###### **2. Tournament Selection**

* **How it works:**
  * Randomly select k individuals from the population (k is tournament size)
  * Choose the best individual from this group as a parent
  * Repeat to select enough parents
  
* **Types:**
  * **Deterministic:** Always select the best from the tournament
  * **Probabilistic:** Select individuals based on probability related to rank
  
* **Example:**
  * With tournament size k=3:
  * Randomly select individuals [5, 2, 9]
  * Choose individual 9 (highest fitness) as parent
  
* **Advantages:**
  * Easy to adjust selection pressure via tournament size
  * Does not require fitness scaling
  * Works well for parallel implementations
  
* **Disadvantages:**
  * May need tuning of tournament size
  * Smaller tournaments can lead to slower convergence

##### **Example:**

* AI designing aircraft wings with optimal aerodynamics.
* Stock market prediction models optimizing investment strategies.

##### **Advantages of GA:**

* Works well for large, complex problems.  
* Finds good solutions even if an exact solution is unknown.
* Can handle discontinuous, non-differentiable functions
* Parallelizable - multiple solutions can be evaluated simultaneously

##### **Disadvantages of GA:**

* Can be slow for real-time applications.  
* Does not guarantee the absolute best solution.
* Requires careful parameter tuning
* May converge prematurely to suboptimal solutions

##### **Comparison: ACO vs. GA**

| Feature | Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) | Genetic Algorithm (GA) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Inspired By** | Ants finding food | Natural evolution |
| **Best For** | Path optimization problems | General optimization problems |
| **Selection Strategy** | Strongest pheromone trail | Best-fit solutions |
| **Improvement Mechanism** | Reinforcing best paths | Crossover & mutation |
| **Convergence Speed** | Can be slow | Faster in many cases |
| **Memory Usage** | Moderate (pheromone trails) | High (population of solutions) |
| **Applications** | Routing, scheduling | Function optimization, machine learning |

* **ACO** is better for pathfinding and routing problems, while **GA** is more versatile for various optimization tasks.

## **Section 3: Game Playing in AI**

>PYQ: What do you mean by Game playing in AI? (2021, 7 marks)     

Game playing is an important area in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves developing algorithms that can play games against human players or other AI systems. Game-playing AI is used in various applications, including board games, video games, and simulations.

Game-playing AI uses **search algorithms** to find the best moves in competitive games like **chess, tic-tac-toe, and checkers**. Two key algorithms used are:

1. **Min-Max Algorithm** (for decision-making in two-player games).  
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning** (an optimization of Min-Max).

#### **Applications of Game Playing in AI**

1. **Chess and Checkers:** AI like IBM's Deep Blue defeated world chess champions using advanced game-playing algorithms.  
2. **Tic-Tac-Toe:** Simple games are used to teach basic AI concepts and algorithms.  
3. **Go:** Google's AlphaGo used advanced AI techniques to beat human champions.  
4. **Video Games:** AI creates intelligent non-player characters (NPCs) that can adapt to player strategies.

### **3.1 Min-Max Algorithm**

The **Min-Max Algorithm** is used in **zero-sum** games, where one player’s gain is another’s loss. The algorithm assumes **both players play optimally** and tries to maximize the chances of winning.

The Min-Max algorithm is used in two-player games where players take turns. It is designed for games with the following characteristics:

* **Deterministic:** No randomness in the game, like chess.  
* **Zero-sum:** One player’s gain is the other player’s loss.

#### **How Min-Max Works:**

1. The game is represented as a **tree** where:  
   * **Maximizing player (MAX)** tries to get the highest score.  
   * **Minimizing player (MIN)** tries to lower the score.  
2. The algorithm evaluates all possible moves up to a certain depth.  
3. It assigns scores to each move based on a heuristic evaluation function.  
4. MAX chooses the move with the **highest value**, while MIN chooses the **lowest value**.  
5. The best move is selected based on the recursive evaluation of all possible moves.

#### **Example (Tic-Tac-Toe):**

Consider a game tree where **MAX (X)** is trying to win, and **MIN (O)** is trying to block:

```
         (MAX)  
         /    \  
      (MIN)  (MIN)  
      /   \    /   \  
    (3)   (5) (2)   (9)
```
    
* MIN selects the **smallest** value from its child nodes → `{3,5} → 3` and `{2,9} → 2`.  
* MAX then picks the **largest** value `{3,2} → 3`.

**Result:** MAX plays the move that leads to **score 3**.

#### **Advantages of Min-Max:**

* Finds the optimal move if all possibilities are explored.  
* Works well for turn-based strategic games.
* Guarantees the best outcome for the maximizing player.

#### **Disadvantages of Min-Max:**

* Computationally expensive for deep game trees.  
* Explores unnecessary branches, making it slow.
* Requires a good evaluation function to assess game states.

### **3.2 Alpha-Beta Pruning**

>PYQ: What do you mean by Game Playing: Min-Max Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning? Explain in detail. (2022, 15 marks)      
>PYQ: Explain Alpha-Beta pruning with example. What is the need of pruning? (2021, 8 marks)

Alpha-Beta Pruning is an **optimization** algorithm that improves the efficiency of the Min-Max algorithm by ignoring branches that will not affect the final decision. It  **cuts off unnecessary branches** in the search tree, reducing computation time.

**Key Idea:** If one move is clearly worse than another, there’s no need to explore further moves in that branch.

#### **Need for Pruning:**
* **Efficiency:** Reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the Min-Max tree.
* **Speed:** Allows deeper searches in the same time frame.
* **Memory Usage:** Reduces memory requirements by not storing all nodes.
* **Optimality:** Still guarantees the best move.
* **Complexity:** Reduces the complexity of the search space.
* **Performance:** Improves performance in large games like chess and checkers.

#### **How Alpha-Beta Pruning Works:**

1. The algorithm uses two values:  
   * **Alpha (α):** The best score that the **Max** player can guarantee so far.  
   * **Beta (β):** The best score that the **Min** player can guarantee so far.  
2. While exploring the game tree:  
   * If the **Max** player finds a move better than the current **Beta**, the **Min** player will avoid that branch.  
   * If the **Min** player finds a move worse than the current **Alpha**, the **Max** player will avoid that branch.  
3. This "pruning" reduces the number of nodes to evaluate.

If at any point, `α ≥ β`, the algorithm can stop exploring that branch because it won't affect the final decision.

#### **Example:**

* In a chess game: If one move leads to a checkmate in fewer steps, other longer paths are ignored.

#### **Example of Pruning:**

```
         (MAX)  
         /    \  
      (MIN)  (MIN)  
      /   \    /   \  
    (3)   (5)  (2)   (9)
```

1. MIN at the left picks the **minimum (3)**.  
2. MAX sees 3 and knows it’s better than the right branch’s **worst possible outcome (≥2)**.  
3. MAX **ignores** further calculations in the right branch (pruning).

#### **Advantages of Alpha-Beta Pruning:**

* Speeds up Min-Max by pruning unnecessary branches. 
* Reduces time complexity from O(b^d) to O(b^(d/2)) in the best case.
* Can reach the best move faster.
* Reduces memory usage by not storing all nodes.
* Allows deeper searches in the same time frame.

#### **Disadvantages of Alpha-Beta Pruning:**

* Still slow for large games if not well optimized.  
* Requires careful ordering of moves for maximum pruning.
* Complexity increases with the number of players.
* May not work well with non-deterministic games.

##### **Comparison: Min-Max vs Alpha-Beta Pruning**

| Feature | Min-Max Algorithm | Alpha-Beta Pruning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Working** | Explores all moves | Prunes unnecessary moves |
| **Efficiency** | Slow for deep trees | Faster due to pruning |
| **Best For** | Small games | Complex games (chess, go) |
| **Memory Usage** | High (stores all nodes) | Lower (prunes branches) |
| **Optimality** | Guarantees optimal move | Guarantees optimal move |
| **Complexity** | O(b^d) | O(b^(d/2)) (best case) |
| **Use Cases** | Simple games | Complex games (AI, robotics) |

* **Min-Max** explores all possible moves, while **Alpha-Beta Pruning** optimizes the search by ignoring branches that won't affect the final decision.
* **Min-Max** is slower for deep trees, while **Alpha-Beta Pruning** is faster due to pruning unnecessary branches.
