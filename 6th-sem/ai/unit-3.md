>PYQ: Explain how uncertainty is managed in AI. (2021, 5 marks)      
>PYQ: What is Probability Theory in terms of Reasoning under Uncertainty? Elaborate with example. (2022, 15 marks)

In real life, AI often deals with situations where information is **incomplete**, **uncertain**, or **not fully reliable**. So, instead of making decisions with exact facts, AI uses **probability** and **logic** to make the best guess. This is where **probabilistic reasoning** comes in.

## **1.1 Basics of Probability Theory**

>PYQ: What is Probability Theory in terms of Reasoning under Uncertainty? Elaborate with example. (2022, 15 marks)

### **What is Probability?**

* **Probability** is a way to measure how **likely** something is to happen.  
* It is a number between **0 and 1**:  
   * `0` means **impossible**  
   * `1` means **certain**  
* Example: Probability of flipping a coin and getting heads = **0.5** (or 50%)

### **Formula of Probability:**

$$P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}$$

**Example:** Rolling a die (6 sides), what's the probability of getting a 4?

* Favorable outcomes \= 1 (only one '4')  
* Total outcomes \= 6  
* So, P(4)=1/6≈0.167

### **Some Important Terms:**

| Term | Meaning | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Experiment** | An action like tossing a coin or rolling a die | Drawing a card from a deck |
| **Sample Space (S)** | All possible outcomes | For a die: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} |
| **Event (E)** | A specific outcome or set of outcomes | Getting an even number on a die |
| **Favorable Outcome** | The result you want to happen | Getting a 6 when you need it |
| **Joint Probability** | Probability of two events occurring together | P(A and B) |
| **Conditional Probability** | Probability of one event given another occurred | P(A\|B) |

### **Types of Probability:**

1. **Theoretical Probability**  
    * Based on logical reasoning  
    * Example: Tossing a coin → 0.5 for heads

2. **Experimental Probability**  
    * Based on real experiments/data  
    * Example: After 100 tosses, heads came 48 times →  
         P(Heads)=48 / 100=0.48

3. **Subjective Probability**
    * Based on personal judgment or expertise
    * Example: A doctor estimating 70% chance of recovery based on experience

### **Rules of Probability:**

1. **Range Rule**: 0≤P(E)≤1  
2. **Sum Rule** (for all outcomes): P(E₁)+P(E₂)+...+P(Eₙ)=1  
3. **Complement Rule**: P(Not E)=1−P(E)
4. **Multiplication Rule**: P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B|A)
5. **Addition Rule**: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

### **Conditional Probability:**

The probability of an event A occurring given that event B has occurred is:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

**Example:** In a class of 30 students, 15 are boys and 10 students passed the exam, including 3 boys. What's the probability that a randomly selected student is a boy, given that they passed the exam?

* P(boy|passed) = P(boy ∩ passed)/P(passed) = 3/10 = 0.3

### **Why Probability is Important in AI?**

* AI often faces situations with **incomplete data**.  
* Probability helps the system **make the best possible decision**.  
* Used in medical diagnosis, spam detection, voice recognition, etc.
* Enables AI to **quantify uncertainty** rather than ignore it.
* Forms the foundation for **machine learning** algorithms.

### **Real-world Applications:**

| Application | How Probability Helps |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Weather Forecasting** | Calculating chance of rain based on atmospheric conditions |
| **Stock Market Prediction** | Estimating probability of price movements |
| **Recommendation Systems** | Determining likelihood a user will enjoy certain content |
| **Natural Language Processing** | Calculating probability of word sequences |

## **1.2 Probabilistic Reasoning** 

### **What is Probabilistic Reasoning?**

* **Probabilistic Reasoning** is a method used by AI to **make decisions or predictions** when it doesn't have full or certain information.  
* It is based on **probability theory**.  
* Instead of saying "Yes" or "No," AI says **"Most likely yes"** or **"Probably no."**

### **Why AI Needs It?**

* In real-world situations, AI doesn't always know everything.  
* For example:  
   * A doctor AI sees a patient with **fever and cough**. It doesn't know the exact disease, but:  
      * Flu: 70% chance  
      * COVID-19: 20% chance  
      * Cold: 10% chance  
    → So, it selects **flu** as the most probable cause.

### **How It Works (Simple Steps):**

1. **Collect Data**  
      (e.g., symptoms, signals, images)  
2. **Calculate Probabilities**  
      (e.g., what's the chance of each possible result)  
3. **Make the Best Guess**  
      (select the one with the **highest probability**)
4. **Update Beliefs**
      (as new information comes in)

### **Example: Spam Email Classification**

Consider an email classifier that determines if messages are spam or legitimate:

| Email Features | Legitimate (P=0.6) | Spam (P=0.4) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Contains "FREE" | 10% chance | 60% chance |
| Contains "Meeting" | 50% chance | 5% chance |
| Has attachment | 30% chance | 40% chance |

When a new email arrives containing "FREE" and an attachment:
- Initial probabilities: P(Legitimate)=0.6, P(Spam)=0.4
- After considering features: 
  - P(Legitimate|features) ∝ 0.6 × 0.1 × 0.3 = 0.018
  - P(Spam|features) ∝ 0.4 × 0.6 × 0.4 = 0.096

→ After normalization, P(Spam|features) ≈ 0.84 (84%)
→ The AI classifies it as **Spam** with high confidence.

### **Another Example:**

A robot is trying to decide whether an object is a ball or a fruit:

| Object Feature | Ball (P=0.3) | Fruit (P=0.7) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Round shape | Very likely | Very likely |
| Soft texture | Less likely | More likely |
| Sweet smell | Very unlikely | Very likely |

→ After analyzing all features, the robot chooses "Fruit" because the overall probability is much higher.

### **Use Cases in AI:**

| Area | How Probabilistic Reasoning Helps | Example Algorithm |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Medical AI** | Predict diseases based on symptoms | Bayesian networks |
| **Spam Filter** | Check if email is spam or not | Naive Bayes classifier |
| **Self-driving cars** | Predict pedestrian movements | Monte Carlo localization |
| **Speech Recognition** | Match voice to most probable words | Hidden Markov Models |
| **Game AI** | Make strategic decisions with incomplete information | Monte Carlo Tree Search |

### **Benefits:**

- Handles uncertainty and incomplete information effectively
- Provides a structured way to update beliefs
- Can model complex relationships between variables
- Widely applicable in various AI domains

### **Limitations:**

- Requires good prior probabilities
- Can be computationally intensive for complex problems
- Sometimes makes unrealistic independence assumptions (in simplified models)
- May struggle with completely novel situations with no prior information

## **1.3 Bayesian Reasoning**

>PYQ: Explain Probability and Bayes Theorem with example. (2023, 15 marks)    
>PYQ: Bayesian Reasoning (2022, 2.5 marks)      
>PYQ: What is the difference between prior and posterior probability? (2024, 1 mark)

### **What is Bayesian Reasoning?**

* **Bayesian Reasoning** is a method in AI that **updates its beliefs** when **new information** (evidence) is available. 
* It is based on **Bayes' Theorem** from probability theory.  
* AI starts with a guess (called **prior probability**) and **updates** it using new data (called **evidence**).

### **Intuitive Example:**

Imagine you're a doctor with a patient showing some symptoms. 
- Initially, you think there's a 10% chance they have Disease X (prior)
- You run a test that is 90% accurate (if someone has Disease X, the test will be positive 90% of the time)
- The test comes back positive
- Should you now believe there's a 90% chance they have Disease X? Not necessarily!

Bayesian reasoning helps you calculate exactly how much to update your belief based on this new evidence.

### **Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

$$P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}$$

Where:
* P(H) = **Prior**: Belief in hypothesis **H** before seeing the evidence  
* P(E∣H) = **Likelihood**: How likely is evidence **E** if hypothesis **H** is true  
* P(E) = Total probability of evidence **E** (can be calculated as P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)P(¬H))
* P(H∣E) = **Posterior**: Updated belief in **H** after seeing evidence **E**

### **Step-by-Step Calculation Example:**

Let's work through a complete example:
- 1% of people have a certain disease (prior probability)
- The test is 95% accurate for those who have the disease (sensitivity)
- The test has a 10% false positive rate (90% specificity)
- If someone tests positive, what's the probability they actually have the disease?

**Step 1:** Identify what we know
- P(Disease) = 0.01 (prior)
- P(Positive|Disease) = 0.95 (likelihood/sensitivity)
- P(Positive|No Disease) = 0.10 (false positive rate)

**Step 2:** Apply Bayes' theorem
- P(Disease|Positive) = [P(Positive|Disease) × P(Disease)] / P(Positive)

**Step 3:** Calculate P(Positive)
- P(Positive) = P(Positive|Disease)×P(Disease) + P(Positive|No Disease)×P(No Disease)
- P(Positive) = 0.95×0.01 + 0.10×0.99 = 0.0095 + 0.099 = 0.1085

**Step 4:** Calculate posterior probability
- P(Disease|Positive) = (0.95×0.01)/0.1085 = 0.0095/0.1085 ≈ 0.0876 or about 8.8%

Despite the positive test result, there's only about a 9% chance the person actually has the disease! This is because the disease is rare (low prior probability).

### **Key Terms:**

1. **Prior Probability**  
    * **Meaning:** Initial belief or guess before seeing any evidence.  
    * **Example:** There's a **1% chance** someone has a disease (before test).  
    * **Mathematical notation:** P(H)

2. **Likelihood**
    * **Meaning:** How likely we are to see the evidence if the hypothesis is true.
    * **Example:** If someone has the disease, there's a 95% chance the test will be positive.
    * **Mathematical notation:** P(E|H)

3. **Evidence (E)**  
    * **Meaning:** New information or data.  
    * **Example:** Person gets a positive test result.
    * **Mathematical notation:** P(E)

4. **Posterior Probability**  
    * **Meaning:** Updated belief after seeing the evidence.  
    * **Example:** After the test, now there's an 8.8% chance they have the disease.
    * **Mathematical notation:** P(H|E)

#### **Difference between Prior and Posterior Probability**

>PYQ: What is the difference between prior and posterior probability? (2024, 1 mark)

| Aspect | Prior Probability | Posterior Probability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Initial probability of an event before new evidence is considered | Updated probability after taking new evidence into account |
| **When Used** | At the beginning of analysis | After collecting and analyzing new evidence |
| **Formula** | P(H) | P(H\|E) = P(E\|H)·P(H)/P(E) |
| **Notation** | Simply P(H) | P(H\|E) (read as "probability of H given E") |
| **Role in Bayesian** | Starting point for Bayesian inference | The result of Bayesian inference |
| **Example** | 1% chance of having a disease before testing | 8.8% chance of having disease after positive test |
| **Mathematical Relationship** | Input to Bayes' theorem | Output of Bayes' theorem |

Prior probability represents our initial belief based on existing information, while posterior probability is the revised belief after incorporating new evidence. The posterior becomes the new prior if additional evidence is obtained later.

### **The Bayesian Update Process:**

1. **Start with prior beliefs** - P(H)
2. **Observe new evidence** - E
3. **Calculate how likely the evidence would be** if hypothesis is true - P(E|H)
4. **Calculate total probability of seeing this evidence** - P(E)
5. **Update belief using Bayes' theorem** - P(H|E)
6. **Use this posterior as the new prior** for future updates

### **Naive Bayes: A Practical Implementation**

Naive Bayes is a popular algorithm based on Bayesian reasoning, widely used for:
- Email spam filtering
- Document classification
- Sentiment analysis

It makes the "naive" assumption that features are independent of each other given the class, which simplifies calculations dramatically.

**Example: Email Spam Classification**
- Prior: P(Spam) = 0.3, P(Not Spam) = 0.7
- If "free" appears: P("free"|Spam) = 0.6, P("free"|Not Spam) = 0.05
- If "meeting" appears: P("meeting"|Spam) = 0.01, P("meeting"|Not Spam) = 0.4

For an email containing both "free" and "meeting":
- P(Spam|words) ∝ 0.3 × 0.6 × 0.01 = 0.0018
- P(Not Spam|words) ∝ 0.7 × 0.05 × 0.4 = 0.014

After normalization, P(Not Spam|words) ≈ 0.89 or 89%, so the email is classified as legitimate.

### **Why It's Useful in AI:**

| Use Case | How Bayesian Reasoning Helps | Example Application |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Medical Diagnosis** | Updates disease probabilities with new test results | COVID-19 risk assessment |
| **Spam Detection** | Analyzes word patterns to filter emails | Gmail's spam filter |
| **Robot Vision** | Updates object identification with better images | Self-driving cars |
| **Voice Assistant** | Improves word recognition as more is spoken | Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant |
| **Recommendation Systems** | Updates user preferences based on interactions | Netflix, Amazon recommendations |

### **Limitations of Bayesian Reasoning:**

- Requires good prior probabilities
- Can be computationally intensive for complex problems
- Sometimes makes unrealistic independence assumptions (in simplified models)
- May struggle with completely novel situations with no prior information

## **1.4 Dempster-Shafer Theory**

>PYQ: Dempster-Shafer Theory (2023, 2.5 marks)     
>PYQ: Explain in detail Dempster-Shafer Theory. (2022, 15 marks)     
>PYQ: Explain Dempster shafer theory with the help of example. (2021, 10 marks)     
>PYQ: What is Dempster-Shafer's theory? Explain with a suitable example. (2024, 15 marks)    
>PYQ: What is the difference between Bayesian and Dempster-Shafer theory? (2024, 1 mark)

### **What is Dempster-Shafer Theory?**

* It is an another **mathematical method** for reasoning under uncertainty — like probability, but more **flexible**. Unlike probability, it allows for **belief** and **doubt** (ignorance). Used when AI has **incomplete or conflicting data**.  
* *It is also called Belief Theory or Evidence Theory.*  
* It allows AI to work with **incomplete**, **uncertain**, or even **conflicting** information.  
* It helps AI to **combine evidence** from different sources and make decisions based on that.
* It gives a **range of belief** instead of just one number.

### **Key Concepts in Detail**

| Term | Meaning | Mathematical Representation |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Frame of Discernment (Θ)** | The set of all possible states or hypotheses | Θ = {A, B, C, ...} |
| **Power Set (2^Θ)** | All possible subsets of the frame | 2^Θ = {∅, {A}, {B}, {A,B}, ...} | 
| **Basic Probability Assignment (m)** | Assigns belief mass to elements of the power set | m: 2^Θ → [0,1], where m(∅)=0 and Σm(A)=1 for all A in 2^Θ |
| **Belief (Bel)** | How much the evidence supports a hypothesis | Bel(A) = Σm(B) for all B⊆A |
| **Plausibility (Pl)** | How much the evidence does not reject a hypothesis | Pl(A) = 1 - Bel(¬A) |
| **Belief Interval** | The range between belief and plausibility | [Bel(A), Pl(A)] |

The key formula to remember is:

**`Belief ≤ Actual Probability ≤ Plausibility`**    

### **DST vs. Traditional Probability**

| Probability Theory | Dempster-Shafer Theory |
| :---: | :---: |
| Needs exact probabilities | Works even with partial or unknown info |
| One number | Range of belief (lower & upper bounds) |
| P(A) + P(not A) = 1 | Bel(A) + Bel(not A) ≤ 1 |
| Cannot represent ignorance directly | Can explicitly represent ignorance |
| Requires complete knowledge | Works with incomplete knowledge |

### **Step-by-Step Example: Medical Diagnosis**

Let's work through a complete example to understand DST:

**Step 1: Define the frame of discernment**
- Θ = {Flu, COVID, Cold} (possible diseases)

**Step 2: Consider evidence from Test 1**
- Test 1 assigns:
  - m₁(Flu) = 0.7 (70% belief specifically in Flu)
  - m₁(Cold) = 0.1 (10% belief specifically in Cold)
  - m₁({Flu, COVID, Cold}) = 0.2 (20% ignorance/uncertainty)

**Step 3: Consider evidence from Test 2**
- Test 2 assigns:
  - m₂(COVID) = 0.6 (60% belief specifically in COVID)
  - m₂({Flu, COVID}) = 0.3 (30% belief it's either Flu or COVID)
  - m₂({Flu, COVID, Cold}) = 0.1 (10% ignorance/uncertainty)

**Step 4: Calculate belief for Flu**
- Bel₁(Flu) = m₁(Flu) = 0.7
- Bel₂(Flu) = m₂(Flu) = 0 (Test 2 gives no specific belief to Flu alone)

**Step 5: Calculate plausibility for Flu**
- Pl₁(Flu) = m₁(Flu) + m₁({Flu, COVID, Cold}) = 0.7 + 0.2 = 0.9
- Pl₂(Flu) = m₂({Flu, COVID}) + m₂({Flu, COVID, Cold}) = 0.3 + 0.1 = 0.4

**Step 6: Combine evidence using Dempster's rule**
- Calculate the combined mass function m₁₂ using Dempster's rule of combination
- After combination, we might get:
  - m₁₂(Flu) = 0.35
  - m₁₂(COVID) = 0.50
  - m₁₂(Cold) = 0.05
  - m₁₂({Flu, COVID}) = 0.10
  - m₁₂({Flu, COVID, Cold}) = 0.00

**Step 7: Calculate final belief and plausibility**
- Bel(Flu) = m₁₂(Flu) = 0.35
- Pl(Flu) = m₁₂(Flu) + m₁₂({Flu, COVID}) = 0.35 + 0.10 = 0.45

**Conclusion:** Based on both tests, we can say with 35% belief that the patient has the Flu, and the plausibility is 45%.

### **Real-Life Example: Fire Detection System**  

A building has multiple sensors for detecting fires:

* **Smoke Sensor** says:
  * m₁(Fire) = 0.6 (60% belief in fire)
  * m₁(No Fire) = 0.1 (10% belief in no fire)
  * m₁({Fire, No Fire}) = 0.3 (30% uncertainty)

* **Temperature Sensor** says:
  * m₂(Fire) = 0.7 (70% belief in fire)
  * m₂(No Fire) = 0.2 (20% belief in no fire)
  * m₂({Fire, No Fire}) = 0.1 (10% uncertainty)

* **After combining evidence:**
  * Belief in Fire = 0.88 (strong evidence for fire)
  * Plausibility of Fire = 0.94 (very little evidence against fire)
  * Belief interval = [0.88, 0.94]

The AI can now make a decision to trigger the fire alarm based on this strong combined belief.

>PYQ: What is the difference between Bayesian and Dempster-Shafer theory? (2024, 1 mark)

### **Difference Between Bayesian and Dempster-Shafer Theory**

| Aspect | Bayesian Theory | Dempster-Shafer Theory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Basic Unit** | Probabilities assigned to specific outcomes | Belief assigned to sets of possibilities |
| **Handling Ignorance** | Requires assigning probabilities even with no evidence | Can explicitly represent ignorance through belief intervals |
| **Precision** | Requires precise prior probabilities | Works with partial or incomplete knowledge |
| **Representation** | Single probability value P(H) | Belief-Plausibility interval [Bel(H), Pl(H)] |
| **Mathematical Approach** | Uses conditional probabilities | Uses belief functions and plausibility |
| **Assumption** | Assumes all possible hypotheses are known | Can handle unknown hypotheses |
| **Evidence Combination** | Uses Bayes' rule for updating | Uses Dempster's rule of combination |
| **Best Used When** | Prior probabilities are reliable | Working with conflicting or incomplete evidence |

Bayesian theory requires specific probability values and assumes complete knowledge of all possible outcomes, while Dempster-Shafer theory can explicitly represent uncertainty using belief intervals and works better with incomplete information.

### **Dempster's Rule of Combination**

Dempster's rule is used to combine evidence from multiple sources. For two basic probability assignments m₁ and m₂, the combined mass function m₁₂ is:

$$m_{1,2}(A) = \frac{1}{1-K} \sum_{B \cap C = A} m_1(B) \cdot m_2(C)$$

Where K represents the degree of conflict between the sources:

$$K = \sum_{B \cap C = \emptyset} m_1(B) \cdot m_2(C)$$

The denominator (1-K) serves as a normalization factor that redistributes the mass of the conflicting evidence.

**Example:**  
 Source 1: m₁(A) = 0.6, m₁(B) = 0.4  
 Source 2: m₂(A) = 0.5, m₂(C) = 0.5  
 → After applying Dempster's rule, we get the combined belief allocation.

### **Applications in AI**

| Field | Use of Dempster-Shafer Theory | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Medical Diagnosis** | Combine results from multiple tests | Integrating blood test and imaging results |
| **Sensor Fusion** | Merge data from different sensors in robots | Combining LIDAR, camera, and radar in autonomous vehicles |
| **Fault Detection** | Detect problems when data is incomplete | Aircraft system monitoring |
| **Decision Making** | Delay or make decisions under uncertainty | Military tactical decision support systems |
| **Image Recognition** | Combine evidence from different features | Multi-feature face recognition systems |

### **Advantages of DST:**

- Can represent **total ignorance** (which Bayesian methods struggle with)
- Doesn't require **prior probabilities**
- Can handle **conflicting evidence**
- Provides **belief intervals** rather than single probabilities
- Allows for **incremental evidence gathering**

### **Limitations of DST:**

- Computationally **expensive** for large frames of discernment
- Dempster's rule can give **counter-intuitive results** with highly conflicting evidence
- Interpretations can be **complex**
- Less **well-established** than Bayesian methods in some domains

## **2. Planning**

Planning in AI is about creating a **step-by-step strategy** for achieving a goal. It's like making a **recipe** for a dish, where you need to know the ingredients (actions) and the steps (order of actions) to make it successfully.

## **2.1 Introduction to Planning**

### **What is Planning in AI?**

* **Planning** is the process of **deciding a sequence of actions** to reach a goal.
* It's like a **roadmap** for an AI agent to follow.
* AI uses planning to figure out **what to do next** to solve a problem or complete a task. It's like making a **step-by-step plan** before acting.  
* It helps the agent think ahead and act in a **smart and goal-oriented** way.  
* Example: A robot planning to go from room A to room B avoiding obstacles.

### **The Planning Process**

1. **Define the goal state** - What should be true when the plan is complete?
2. **Analyze the current state** - What is true now?
3. **Identify available actions** - What can the agent do?
4. **Create a plan** - Find a sequence of actions to transform the current state to the goal state
5. **Execute the plan** - Perform the actions in order
6. **Monitor and replan if necessary** - Adjust if unexpected things happen

### **Searching vs Planning**

>PYQ: What is the difference between searching vs planning? (2024, 1 mark)

| Aspect | Search | Planning |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Definition** | Finding a solution in a space of possibilities | Creating a sequence of actions to achieve a goal |
| **Goal** | Find a path or solution | Create a plan of actions |
| **State Space** | Represents all possible states | Represents all possible actions and their effects |
| **Search Space** | Explores paths to find a solution | Explores actions to create a plan |
| **Example** | Finding a route on a map | Planning a trip with stops and activities |
| **Focus** | Finding a solution path | Understanding action effects and dependencies |
| **Complexity** | Usually simpler, well-defined space | Often more complex with many interacting factors |

### **Why is Planning Important?**

* Helps AI to **act intelligently** by considering future consequences.
* Without planning, an AI might take **random actions**.  
* Planning ensures actions are **efficient, correct**, and **goal-directed**.  
* Useful in robotics, games, assistants, and logistics.
* Enables AI to **solve complex problems** that require multiple steps.
* Allows for **optimizing resources** and managing constraints.

### **Key Elements of Planning**

1. **Initial State \-** The starting point of the agent.  
2. **Goal State \-** The desired condition or result.  
3. **Actions \-** The steps (possible moves or operations) that change the state.  
4. **Plan \-** A set of ordered actions to reach the goal.
5. **Action Model \-** Defines how actions change the world.
6. **Constraints \-** Limitations on possible plans.

### **Interactive Example: Robot Navigation**  

A robot needs to move from the bedroom to the kitchen to fetch a glass of water.

* **Initial state**: Robot in bedroom  
* **Goal state**: Robot in kitchen with water glass  
* **Actions available**: 
  * Move(From, To) - Move from one room to another
  * Open(Door) - Open a closed door
  * GrabItem(Item) - Pick up an item
  * FillGlass(Glass, Water) - Fill a glass with water

* **Plan creation**:
  1. Move(Bedroom, Hallway)
  2. Open(KitchenDoor)
  3. Move(Hallway, Kitchen)
  4. GrabItem(Glass)
  5. FillGlass(Glass, Water)

* **Constraints**:
  * Cannot move through closed doors
  * Cannot grab items not in the current room
  * Cannot fill glass unless holding it

### **Characteristics of Planning Problems**

| Type | Description | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Single-agent** | One agent plans alone | Robot vacuum cleaning a room |
| **Multi-agent** | Multiple agents plan together | Team of robots in a warehouse |
| **Fully Observable** | The agent sees the complete environment | Chess game |
| **Partially Observable** | Some parts are hidden or unknown | Exploring an unknown building |
| **Deterministic** | Every action has a predictable result | Basic assembly robot |
| **Non-Deterministic** | Actions may have different outcomes | Outdoor drone delivery |
| **Static** | World doesn't change during planning | Solving a puzzle |
| **Dynamic** | The world may change, planning must adapt | Self-driving car in traffic |
| **Discrete** | Finite number of states and actions | Chess game |
| **Continuous** | Infinite possible states/actions | Robot arm movement |

### **Planning Algorithms**

1. **Forward Planning**
   * Starts from initial state and works forward
   * Example: Progression planners

2. **Backward Planning**
   * Starts from goal state and works backward
   * Example: Regression planners

3. **Hierarchical Planning**
   * Breaks complex problems into simpler subproblems
   * Example: Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning

4. **Contingency Planning**
   * Plans for different possible outcomes
   * Example: Decision trees in uncertain environments

### **Real-World Uses of AI Planning**

| Field | Planning Example | Real-World Application |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Robotics** | Moving objects, navigating rooms | Amazon warehouse robots |
| **Gaming** | Enemy move strategies | AlphaGo, game NPCs |
| **Delivery apps** | Route and time planning | UPS delivery optimization |
| **Smart homes** | Task scheduling (lights, cleaning) | Google Nest routines |
| **Space Exploration** | Mission planning for rovers | NASA Mars rover operations |

### **Challenges in AI Planning**

* **Computational complexity** - Planning is often NP-hard
* **Uncertainty** - The real world isn't perfectly predictable
* **Dynamic environments** - Things change while planning/executing
* **Partial observability** - Cannot see everything
* **Continuous domains** - Infinite possible states
* **Resource constraints** - Time, energy, and other limitations

## **2.2 Representation of Planning**

>PYQ: How do we represent states, goals and actions in planning? Explain with example. (2021, 8 marks)

### **What is Planning Representation?**

* It means **how the planning problem is described** in a way the AI can understand and solve.  
* The AI needs to know:  
  * What the **initial situation** is,  
  * What the **goal** is,  
  * What **actions** are possible,  
  * And how each action **changes the state**.

### **Components of Planning Representation**

| Component | Description | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **States** | A snapshot of the environment at a given time | "Robot is in room A, door is closed, light is off" |
| **Actions** | Steps that can be taken to move from one state to another | "Move(A,B)", "OpenDoor(D)", "TurnOnLight(L)" |
| **Initial State** | Where planning begins | "Robot is in Room A, all doors are closed" |
| **Goal State** | What we want to achieve | "Robot is in Room C, holding the book" |
| **Transition Model** | Describes how actions change the state | "After OpenDoor(D), door D becomes open" |
| **Action Cost** | Resources required for each action | "Moving between rooms takes 5 energy units" |
| **Heuristic Function** | Estimates cost to reach goal from current state | "Straight-line distance to goal room" |

### **Formal Definition of a Planning Problem**

A planning problem can be defined as a tuple (S, A, I, G) where:
- S = set of all possible states
- A = set of all possible actions
- I = initial state (I ∈ S)
- G = goal state or set of goal states (G ⊆ S)

Additionally:
- Each action a ∈ A is defined by:
  - Preconditions: states where a can be applied
  - Effects: how a changes the state

### **Languages for Planning Representation**

1. **STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver)**
   * The original and most influential planning language
   * Uses add and delete lists for effects

2. **ADL (Action Description Language)**
   * Extends STRIPS with more expressive constructs
   * Allows conditional effects and more

3. **PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language)**
   * Modern standard for planning problems
   * Used in International Planning Competitions
   * Supports various extensions (temporal planning, preferences, etc.)

### **Action Representation: STRIPS**

One of the most popular formats to represent planning actions is **STRIPS**:

* **STRIPS \= Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver**

Each action in STRIPS has 3 parts:

1. **Preconditions** – What must be true before the action  
2. **Action** – The task to be done  
3. **Effects** – What changes after the action

### **Example of STRIPS**

**Goal**: Robot moves from room A to room B

Action: Move(A, B)      
Preconditions: At(Robot, A)     
Effects: ¬At(Robot, A), At(Robot, B)

* The robot must be **in A** to move.  
* After moving, it's **no longer in A** and is **now in B**.

### **Planning as State Space Search**

* Planning problems can be **converted into a search problem**.  
* Each **state** is a node, and **actions** are paths to next states.  
* AI searches for the **path from the start state to the goal state**.

**Search strategies used in planning:**
1. **Forward search (progression)** - Start at the initial state and apply actions
2. **Backward search (regression)** - Start at the goal and work backward
3. **Bidirectional search** - Work from both initial and goal states

### **Common Representation Techniques**

| Method | Description | Advantages |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **State-space representation** | Treats planning as a search in a graph of states | Intuitive, direct mapping to search algorithms |
| **STRIPS** | Defines actions with preconditions and effects | Simple, well-studied, efficient |
| **Planning Graphs** | Shows all possible actions at each level | Accelerates planning, provides heuristics |
| **Hierarchical Task Networks** | Decomposes tasks into subtasks | Handles complex problems, mirrors human planning |
| **Temporal Planning** | Includes time and duration | Models real-world timing constraints |
| **Probabilistic Planning** | Includes uncertain outcomes | Handles realistic uncertainty |

## **2.3 Partial-Order Planning** 

>PYQ: Discuss partial-order plan with example. (2021, 7 marks)    
>PYQ: What is Partial-order Planning? Explain in detail. (2023, 15 marks)     
>PYQ: Explain partial-order planning with a suitable example. (2024, 15 marks)      
>PYQ: Which are the components of the partial-order planning? (2024, 1 mark)

### **What is Partial-Order Planning?**

* Partial-Order Planning (POP) is a planning method where **not all steps** have to be in a **fixed order**. Only those steps that depend on each other are ordered.  
* Also called **non-linear planning**.  
* It **plans only what's necessary** — the rest can happen in **any order**.  
* Also called **"least commitment planning"**, because it avoids making decisions too early.  
* Partial-order planning is **flexible** and avoids unnecessary restrictions.

### **Total-Order vs. Partial-Order Plans**

| Total-Order Plans | Partial-Order Plans |
| :---: | :---: |
| All actions are arranged in a sequence | Only necessary ordering constraints are specified |
| Like a to-do list with numbered steps | Like a dependency graph |
| Less flexible during execution | More flexible, allows parallel execution |
| Example: "First A, then B, then C, then D" | Example: "A before C, B before D" (A and B can be in any order) |
| Represented as a sequence | Represented as a directed graph |

### **Why Use Partial-Order Planning?**

* More **flexible** than step-by-step planning.  
* Useful when **some actions are independent** and can be done in **parallel** or **any order**.  
* Helps in situations where **full details** are not known at the beginning.
* **Reduces backtracking** during planning.
* Allows for **resource optimization** and **parallel execution**.
* **Closer to human planning** - we often think in terms of dependencies rather than fixed sequences.

>PYQ: Which are the components of the partial-order planning? (2024, 1 mark)

#### **Components of Partial-Order Planning**
1. **Actions** - Steps or operations that change the state of the world
2. **Initial and Goal States** - Start and end conditions of the planning problem
3. **Plan** - A set of actions to achieve a goal
4. **Ordering Constraints (O)** - Rules that say which action should come before another
5. **Causal Links (L)** - Relationships showing that one action produces a condition needed by another
6. **Open Preconditions** - Conditions that are required but not yet satisfied by any action
7. **Threats** - Conflicts where one action might interfere with a causal link between other actions

The core components are the actions, ordering constraints, causal links, and the mechanism to identify and resolve threats through constraint posting.

### **The POP Algorithm**

The basic algorithm for partial-order planning:

1. **Start** with an empty plan containing only Start and Finish actions
2. **Select** an open precondition p from some action a₂
3. **Choose** an action a₁ (existing or new) that achieves p
4. **Add** a causal link a₁ →ᵖ a₂
5. **Add** an ordering constraint a₁ < a₂
6. **Check** for threats and resolve them
7. **Repeat** until no open preconditions remain

### **How Partial-Order Planning Works:**

1. Start with an **empty plan** (just start and goal).  
2. Choose a goal condition.  
3. Add actions that achieve that condition.  
4. Add **ordering constraints** only when needed.  
5. Repeat until all goals are achieved.
6. **Resolve threats** by adding ordering constraints or new actions.

#### **Example of Partial-Order Planning**  
Let's say we want to create a simple plan for a robot to make tea:
1. **Initial State**: Robot is in the kitchen, no tea made.
2. **Goal State**: Robot has made tea.
3. **Actions**:
   - BoilWater
   - AddTea
   - PourWater
   - StirTea
4. **Causal Links**:
   - BoilWater → AddTea (need hot water to add tea)
   - PourWater → StirTea (need to stir after pouring)
5. **Ordering Constraints**:
    - BoilWater < PourWater (water must be boiled before pouring)
    - PourWater < StirTea (pouring must happen before stirring)
6. **Open Preconditions**:
    - AddTea (needs BoilWater)
    - StirTea (needs PourWater)
7. **Final Plan**:
    ```
    1. BoilWater
    2. PourWater
    3. AddTea
    4. StirTea
    ```
The robot can execute these actions in parallel where possible, like boiling water while preparing the tea.

### **Advantages of POP**

* **More efficient** in many cases.  
* Allows for **parallel execution** of tasks.  
* Delays decisions to keep the plan flexible.
* Can handle **uncertainty** and **dynamic changes** better.
* **Less backtracking** compared to total-order planning.


### **Disadvantages of POP**
* More **complex** to implement than total-order planning.
* Requires more **memory** to store the partial-order graph.
* Can be **harder to understand** and visualize.
* May require **more sophisticated algorithms** to resolve conflicts and threats.
