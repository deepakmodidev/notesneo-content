## **2. Types of Learning**

>PYQ: Explain the following types of learning: Learning by Induction, Rote Learning, Symbol Based Learning. (2023, 15 marks)

## **2.1 Learning by Induction**

### **What is Inductive Learning?**

Inductive learning is a method where AI **draws general conclusions** from specific examples or observations. It's like going from specific cases to general rules. This type of learning is often used in machine learning to create models that can predict outcomes based on patterns found in the data.

### **How Inductive Learning Works:**

1. **Observe** multiple examples
2. **Identify** common patterns
3. **Formulate** a general rule or hypothesis
4. **Apply** this rule to new situations

### **Example:**

* After seeing many animals with features like fur, four legs, wagging tails, and barking, AI **induces** that these are characteristics of dogs.
* When it sees a new animal with these features, it classifies it as a dog.

### **Types of Inductive Learning:**

1. **Supervised Induction** - Learning from labeled examples
2. **Unsupervised Induction** - Finding patterns without labels
3. **Semi-supervised Induction** - Using both labeled and unlabeled data

### **Advantages of Inductive Learning:**

* Can handle **incomplete information**
* Adapts to **new situations** not explicitly programmed
* Works with **large datasets** effectively

### **Disadvantages:**

* May make **incorrect generalizations**
* Requires **good quality data**
* May struggle with **exceptions to rules**

## **2.2 Rote Learning**

### **What is Rote Learning?**

Rote Learning is the simplest form of learning where AI **memorizes information exactly as presented** without understanding or generalizing. It's like a student memorizing facts without understanding the underlying concepts. This method is often used for tasks that require exact recall of information, such as memorizing formulas or specific data points.

### **How Rote Learning Works:**

1. **Store** specific input-output pairs or facts in memory
2. **Retrieve** the exact stored information when needed
3. **No processing** or understanding of the information

### **Example:**

* An AI that memorizes the equation "2 + 2 = 4" will only know this specific fact
* It cannot solve "2 + 3" unless this is also explicitly stored

### **Applications of Rote Learning:**
1. **Data Storage** - Storing exact values for quick access
2. **Knowledge Bases** - Storing facts and rules for retrieval
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Memorizing specific patterns for recognition
4. **Game Strategies** - Memorizing successful moves in games
5. **Language Translation** - Memorizing phrases and their translations

### **Advantages of Rote Learning:**

* **Fast retrieval** of information
* **Perfect accuracy** for known cases
* **No computation** required during retrieval

### **Disadvantages:**

* **Limited flexibility** - cannot handle new situations
* **Memory intensive** - needs storage for all cases
* **No generalization** - cannot apply knowledge to new situations

## **2.3 Symbol-Based Learning**

### **What is Symbol-Based Learning?**

Symbol-Based Learning uses **symbolic representations** (like words, logic statements, or rules) to acquire, manipulate, and store knowledge. It focuses on learning **high-level concepts** and relationships that can be expressed symbolically. This approach is often used in expert systems and knowledge-based systems where human-like reasoning is required.

### **Key Features:**

* Uses **symbols and logical rules** to represent knowledge
* Relies on **explicit knowledge representation**
* Makes **logical inferences** and deductions
* Focuses on **human-readable knowledge**

### **Components of Symbol-Based Learning:**

1. **Knowledge Representation** - How information is encoded (rules, frames, logic)
2. **Learning Mechanisms** - Methods to acquire new symbols and rules
3. **Inference Engine** - System for making logical deductions
4. **Explanation Module** - For tracing reasoning process

### **Example:**

* An AI system learns rules about animal classification:
  * IF has_fur AND makes_barking_sound THEN is_dog
  * IF has_scales AND swims THEN is_fish
* It can add new rules as it learns more about different animals

### **Advantages:**

* **Explainable** - reasoning can be traced and understood
* **Human-readable** - knowledge represented in understandable form
* **Handles abstract concepts** well

### **Disadvantages:**

* **Knowledge acquisition bottleneck** - difficult to encode all knowledge
* **Brittle** - typically cannot handle unforeseen situations
* **Limited with fuzzy concepts** - struggles with uncertainty

## **2.4 Identification Trees**

>PYQ: Identification Trees (2023, 2.5 marks)

### **What are Identification Trees?**

Identification Trees (also known as Decision Trees) are a **tree-structured learning model** where each node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision, and each leaf represents an outcome or classification.

### **How Identification Trees Work:**

1. **Select the most informative feature** to split the data
2. **Create branches** based on feature values
3. **Recursively build sub-trees** for each branch
4. **Stop** when all samples in a node belong to the same class or no more features remain

### **Example:**

For classifying whether to play tennis:

```
Outlook
   |-- Sunny: Check Humidity
   |     |-- High: Don't Play
   |     |-- Normal: Play
   |-- Overcast: Play
   |-- Rain: Check Wind
         |-- Strong: Don't Play
         |-- Weak: Play
```

### **Building the Tree:**

* Uses metrics like **Information Gain**, **Gini Index**, or **Entropy** to select which feature to split on
* Chooses features that best separate the data into distinct classes

### **Advantages:**

* **Easy to understand and interpret**
* **Handles both numerical and categorical data**
* **Requires little data preprocessing**
* **Can handle missing values**

### **Disadvantages:**

* **Can create overly complex trees** that don't generalize well
* **Sensitive to small changes** in the training data
* **Biased toward features with many levels**
* **May not capture complex relationships**

## **2.5 Explanation-Based Learning**

>PYQ: Explanation Based Learning (2023, 2.5 marks)    
>PYQ: Define explanation-based learning (2024, 1 mark)

### **What is Explanation-Based Learning (EBL)?**

Explanation-Based Learning is an approach where the AI system **creates general rules from a single example** by using prior knowledge to explain why the example works. It focuses on using **domain knowledge** to identify what's important in an example.

### **How EBL Works:**

1. **Observe** an example
2. **Construct an explanation** using prior knowledge
3. **Identify the critical features** that made the example work
4. **Generalize** to create a rule that captures these critical features

### **Components of EBL:**

| Component | Role |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Domain Theory** | Prior knowledge used to explain examples |
| **Training Example** | Specific case to learn from |
| **Goal Concept** | What the system is trying to learn |
| **Operationality Criteria** | What makes a concept usable |

### **Example:**

* **Example:** A particular chess move led to checkmate
* **Explanation:** The move trapped the king with no escape squares
* **Generalization:** "When a king has no escape squares and is under attack, it's checkmate"
* This rule can now be applied to new situations

### **Advantages:**

* **Learns from few examples** - even just one
* **Creates focused, useful rules**
* **Utilizes domain knowledge**
* **Produces explainable results**

### **Disadvantages:**

* **Requires extensive domain knowledge**
* **Limited by accuracy of prior knowledge**
* **Computationally intensive** to construct explanations
* **May not handle noisy or incomplete data well**

## **2.6 Transformational Analogy**

>PYQ: Transformational Analogy (2022, 2.5 marks)

### **What is Transformational Analogy?**

Transformational Analogy is a learning method where AI **solves new problems by recalling solutions to similar problems** and adapting them to fit the current situation.

### **How Transformational Analogy Works:**

1. **Retrieve** a similar problem and its solution from memory
2. **Map** the elements of the old problem to the new problem
3. **Transform** the old solution to fit the new problem
4. **Adjust** the transformed solution if necessary
5. **Store** the new problem-solution pair for future use

### **Key Components:**

1. **Case Base** - Library of previous problems and solutions
2. **Retrieval Mechanism** - Method for finding relevant cases
3. **Mapping Algorithm** - Process for relating old and new problems
4. **Transformation Rules** - How to adapt solutions
5. **Evaluation** - Testing if adapted solution works

### **Example:**

* **Old Problem:** Route planning for a delivery truck in New York
* **New Problem:** Route planning for a delivery truck in Boston
* **Transformation:** Adapt the New York route by accounting for Boston's different street layout and traffic patterns
* **Result:** A working delivery route for Boston

### **Applications:**

| Field | Application |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Design** | Adapting existing designs for new products |
| **Medicine** | Using previous treatment plans for similar conditions |
| **Law** | Applying precedent cases to new legal situations |
| **Strategy Games** | Adapting successful strategies to new game scenarios |

### **Advantages:**

* **Efficient** - doesn't solve problems from scratch
* **Builds on experience** - uses successful past solutions
* **Handles complex problems** that are hard to solve algorithmically
* **Human-like reasoning** process

### **Disadvantages:**

* **Limited by available examples** in memory
* **Transformation can be complex** and difficult to automate
* **May apply inappropriate solutions** if similarity assessment is poor
* **Requires good indexing** of previous cases

>PYQ: What is an Activation Function? (2024, 1 mark)    
>PYQ: Why do neural networks need an activation function? Classify different types of neural network activation functions. (2024, 15 marks)

### **What is an Activation Function?**

An activation function is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron that determines whether it should be activated ("fired") or not based on the weighted sum of its inputs. It introduces non-linearity into the network's output.

### **Why Neural Networks Need Activation Functions**
1. **Non-linearity** - Allows the network to learn complex patterns
2. **Decision Making** - Determines if a neuron should be activated
3. **Output Range** - Maps outputs to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1)
4. **Gradient Descent** - Helps in optimizing the learning process
5. **Control Information Flow** - Filters information passing through the network

### **Types of Activation Functions:**

#### **1. Binary Step Function**
* **Formula:** f(x) = 0 if x < 0, f(x) = 1 if x ≥ 0
* **Use:** Early neural networks, classification
* **Limitation:** Not differentiable at x=0, binary output limits learning

#### **2. Linear Activation Function**
* **Formula:** f(x) = x
* **Use:** Regression problems, output layers
* **Limitation:** Cannot solve non-linear problems, no matter how many layers

#### **3. Sigmoid (Logistic) Function**
* **Formula:** f(x) = 1/(1+e^(-x))
* **Use:** Binary classification, older networks, output layers
* **Limitations:**
  * Vanishing gradient problem
  * Outputs not zero-centered
  * Computationally expensive

#### **4. Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)**
* **Formula:** f(x) = (e^x - e^(-x))/(e^x + e^(-x))
* **Use:** Hidden layers, classification
* **Advantages:** Zero-centered outputs (-1 to 1)
* **Limitation:** Still suffers from vanishing gradient

#### **5. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**
* **Formula:** f(x) = max(0,x)
* **Use:** Hidden layers in most modern networks
* **Advantages:**
  * Computationally efficient
  * Reduces vanishing gradient
  * Sparse activation
* **Limitation:** "Dying ReLU" problem - neurons can die

#### **6. Leaky ReLU**
* **Formula:** f(x) = max(αx,x) where α is small (e.g., 0.01)
* **Use:** Alternative to ReLU
* **Advantage:** Prevents dying ReLU issue

#### **7. Parametric ReLU (PReLU)**
* **Formula:** f(x) = max(αx,x) where α is learnable
* **Use:** Deep networks requiring adaptive activation
* **Advantage:** Parameter α is learned during training

#### **8. Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)**
* **Formula:** f(x) = x if x > 0, f(x) = α(e^x - 1) if x ≤ 0
* **Use:** Deep learning networks
* **Advantages:** Smoother gradient, pushes mean closer to zero

#### **9. Softmax Function**
* **Formula:** f(x_i) = e^(x_i)/Σ(e^(x_j))
* **Use:** Multi-class classification output layers
* **Advantage:** Outputs are probabilities that sum to 1
