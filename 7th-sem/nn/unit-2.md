## **Section 1: McCulloch-Pitts Neural Network (MCP Model)**

### **1.1 Introduction to MCP Model**

> PYQ: Describe the McCulloch-Pitts (MCP) model in detail. Discuss its architecture, working and the solution for OR functions. (2024, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: McCulloch Pitts Model (2023, 15 marks)

**What is McCulloch-Pitts Model?**

The **McCulloch-Pitts (MCP) Model** is the first mathematical model of a biological neuron, created in 1943 by Warren McCulloch (neuroscientist) and Walter Pitts (mathematician). It's the foundation of all modern neural networks.

**Historical Significance:**

This model proved that:
- Neurons can perform logical operations (AND, OR, NOT)
- Networks of neurons can compute any logical function
- Brain-like computation is possible with simple units

**Key Characteristics:**

- Binary inputs (0 or 1)
- Binary output (0 or 1)
- Fixed threshold
- No learning capability (weights are fixed)
- Boolean logic operations

**Simple Explanation:**

Think of the MCP neuron as a simple decision-maker that:
1. Receives multiple yes/no inputs
2. Counts how many "yes" inputs it gets
3. If the count reaches a threshold, it says "yes" (fires)
4. Otherwise, it says "no" (doesn't fire)

*Figure 2.1: McCulloch-Pitts Neuron Model - Shows inputs (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ), weights (w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ), summation function (Σ), and threshold activation.*

**Components:**

**1. Inputs (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ):**
- Binary values: 0 or 1
- Represent presence (1) or absence (0) of a signal
- Can have multiple inputs

**2. Weights (w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ):**
- **Excitatory weights:** +1 (encourage firing)
- **Inhibitory weights:** -1 (prevent firing)
- Fixed (not learned)

**3. Summation Function (Σ):**
- Adds up all weighted inputs
- Formula: Σ = (x₁×w₁) + (x₂×w₂) + ... + (xₙ×wₙ)

**4. Threshold (θ):**
- Fixed value
- Decision boundary
- Determines when neuron fires

**5. Output (y):**
- Binary: 0 or 1
- 1 if sum ≥ threshold
- 0 if sum < threshold

---

### **1.3 Working of MCP Model**

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Receive Inputs**
- Get binary inputs (0 or 1) from other neurons or external sources

**Step 2: Apply Weights**
- Multiply each input by its weight
- Excitatory: multiply by +1
- Inhibitory: multiply by -1

**Step 3: Calculate Sum**
- Add all weighted inputs
- Σ = Σ(xᵢ × wᵢ)

**Step 4: Compare with Threshold**
- If Σ ≥ θ → Output = 1 (neuron fires)
- If Σ < θ → Output = 0 (neuron doesn't fire)

**Mathematical Representation:**

```
y = 1,  if Σ(xᵢ × wᵢ) ≥ θ
y = 0,  if Σ(xᵢ × wᵢ) < θ

Or using step function:
y = step(Σ(xᵢ × wᵢ) - θ)
```

### **1.4 MCP Model for AND Function**

> PYQ: Solution of AND function using MCP model (2024, 15 marks)

AND function can be implemented using MCP model by setting the weights to 1 and the threshold to 2.

**AND Function Truth Table:**

| x₁ | x₂ | y (x₁ AND x₂) |
|----|----|---------------|
| 0  | 0  | 0             |
| 0  | 1  | 0             |
| 1  | 0  | 0             |
| 1  | 1  | 1             |

**Logic:** Output is 1 only when BOTH inputs are 1.

**MCP Design for AND:**

```
x₁ ────→ [w₁ = 1]
                  ↘
                   Σ ──→ [θ = 2] ──→ y
                  ↗
x₂ ────→ [w₂ = 1]
```

**Parameters:**
- Weights: w₁ = 1, w₂ = 1 (both excitatory)
- Threshold: θ = 2

**Why θ = 2?**
- For output to be 1, we need BOTH inputs to be 1
- Sum = 1×1 + 1×1 = 2
- So threshold should be 2

**Verification:**

**Case 1: x₁ = 0, x₂ = 0**
```
Σ = (0×1) + (0×1) = 0
Since 0 < 2 → y = 0 ✓
```

**Case 2: x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1**
```
Σ = (0×1) + (1×1) = 1
Since 1 < 2 → y = 0 ✓
```

**Case 3: x₁ = 1, x₂ = 0**
```
Σ = (1×1) + (0×1) = 1
Since 1 < 2 → y = 0 ✓
```

**Case 4: x₁ = 1, x₂ = 1**
```
Σ = (1×1) + (1×1) = 2
Since 2 ≥ 2 → y = 1 ✓
```

**Complete Solution Table:**

| x₁ | x₂ | w₁×x₁ | w₂×x₂ | Σ | θ | y |
|----|----| ------|-------|---|---|---|
| 0  | 0  | 0     | 0     | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| 0  | 1  | 0     | 1     | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| 1  | 0  | 1     | 0     | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| 1  | 1  | 1     | 1     | 2 | 2 | 1 |

### **1.5 MCP Model for OR Function**

> PYQ: Solution of OR function using MCP model (2024, 15 marks)

OR function can be implemented using MCP model by setting the weights to 1 and the threshold to 1.

**OR Function Truth Table:**

| x₁ | x₂ | y (x₁ OR x₂) |
|----|----|--------------|
| 0  | 0  | 0            |
| 0  | 1  | 1            |
| 1  | 0  | 1            |
| 1  | 1  | 1            |

**Logic:** Output is 1 when AT LEAST ONE input is 1.

**MCP Design for OR:**

```
x₁ ────→ [w₁ = 1]
                  ↘
                   Σ ──→ [θ = 1] ──→ y
                  ↗
x₂ ────→ [w₂ = 1]
```

**Parameters:**
- Weights: w₁ = 1, w₂ = 1 (both excitatory)
- Threshold: θ = 1

**Why θ = 1?**
- For output to be 1, we need AT LEAST ONE input to be 1
- Minimum sum when one input is 1: 1×1 = 1
- So threshold should be 1

**Verification:**

**Case 1: x₁ = 0, x₂ = 0**
```
Σ = (0×1) + (0×1) = 0
Since 0 < 1 → y = 0 ✓
```

**Case 2: x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1**
```
Σ = (0×1) + (1×1) = 1
Since 1 ≥ 1 → y = 1 ✓
```

**Case 3: x₁ = 1, x₂ = 0**
```
Σ = (1×1) + (0×1) = 1
Since 1 ≥ 1 → y = 1 ✓
```

**Case 4: x₁ = 1, x₂ = 1**
```
Σ = (1×1) + (1×1) = 2
Since 2 ≥ 1 → y = 1 ✓
```

**Complete Solution Table:**

| x₁ | x₂ | w₁×x₁ | w₂×x₂ | Σ | θ | y |
|----|----| ------|-------|---|---|---|
| 0  | 0  | 0     | 0     | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0  | 1  | 0     | 1     | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1  | 0  | 1     | 0     | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1  | 1  | 1     | 1     | 2 | 1 | 1 |

---

### **1.6 MCP Model for NOT Function**

NOT function can be implemented using MCP model by setting the weight to -1 and the threshold to 0.

**NOT Function Truth Table:**

| x | y (NOT x) |
|---|-----------|
| 0 | 1         |
| 1 | 0         |

**Logic:** Output is opposite of input.

**MCP Design for NOT:**

```
x ────→ [w = -1] ──→ Σ ──→ [θ = 0] ──→ y
```

**Parameters:**
- Weight: w = -1 (inhibitory)
- Threshold: θ = 0

**Verification:**

**Case 1: x = 0**
```
Σ = 0×(-1) = 0
Since 0 ≥ 0 → y = 1 ✓
```

**Case 2: x = 1**
```
Σ = 1×(-1) = -1
Since -1 < 0 → y = 0 ✓
```

**Complete Solution Table:**

| x | w×x | Σ | θ | y |
|---|-----|---|---|---|
| 0 |  0  | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | -1  |-1 | 0 | 0 |

## **Section 2: Hebb Model**

### **2.1 Introduction to Hebb Model**

> PYQ: Explain Hebbian Model and implement logic 'AND' function using Hebb Network. (2024, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Explain Hebbian Model and implement logic 'AND' function using Hebb Network. (2023, 15 marks)

**What is Hebb Model?**

The **Hebb Model** (1949) is a neural network that can **learn** from examples. It was proposed by Donald Hebb, a Canadian psychologist, based on how biological neurons learn.

**Hebb's Learning Rule:**

> **"Cells that fire together, wire together"**

This means:
- When two neurons are active at the same time, the connection between them gets stronger
- When they're not active together, the connection weakens or stays the same

**Key Innovation:**

Unlike MCP model (fixed weights), Hebb model can **adjust weights** based on training data. This was the first learning algorithm for neural networks!

**Characteristics:**

- Can learn from examples
- Adjusts weights automatically
- Simple learning rule
- Supervised learning
- Used for pattern association

### **2.2 Architecture of Hebb Model**

**Structure:**

```
Training Phase:
    Inputs (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ)
        ↓
    Initial Weights (w₁=0, w₂=0, ..., wₙ=0)
        ↓
    Weight Update (Hebbian Learning)
        ↓
    Final Weights
    
Testing Phase:
    New Inputs
        ↓
    Learned Weights
        ↓
    Summation
        ↓
    Activation Function
        ↓
    Output
```

**Components:**

1. **Input Layer:** Receives input patterns
2. **Weights:** Initially zero, updated during training
3. **Bias:** Additional adjustable parameter
4. **Activation Function:** Usually step function or bipolar step
5. **Output:** Predicted result

---

### **2.3 Hebbian Learning Algorithm**

**Training Algorithm:**

```
Step 1: Initialize
    Set all weights to 0: w₁ = w₂ = ... = wₙ = 0
    Set bias to 0: b = 0

Step 2: For each training pattern (x, y):
    Step 2a: Calculate weight updates
        Δwᵢ = xᵢ × y  (for each input i)
        Δb = y
    
    Step 2b: Update weights
        wᵢ(new) = wᵢ(old) + Δwᵢ
        b(new) = b(old) + Δb

Step 3: Repeat Step 2 for all training patterns

Step 4: Final weights are learned
```

**Mathematical Formula:**

```
Weight Update:
wᵢ(new) = wᵢ(old) + (xᵢ × y)

Bias Update:
b(new) = b(old) + y

Where:
- xᵢ = input value
- y = desired output (target)
- wᵢ = weight for input i
- b = bias
```

**Testing Algorithm:**

```
Step 1: For new input pattern x:
    Calculate: y_in = Σ(xᵢ × wᵢ) + b

Step 2: Apply activation function:
    If y_in ≥ 0: y = +1
    If y_in < 0: y = -1  (for bipolar)
    
    Or:
    If y_in ≥ 0: y = 1
    If y_in < 0: y = 0   (for binary)

Step 3: Output y

Where:
- y_in = input to activation function
- y = output of activation function
```

### **2.4 Hebb Network for AND Function**

> PYQ: Implement logic 'AND' function using Hebb Network (2024, 2023, 15 marks)

**Problem Statement:**

Design a Hebb network to implement the AND function using bipolar inputs and outputs.

**AND Function Truth Table (Bipolar):**

| x₁ | x₂ | y (x₁ AND x₂) |
|----|----| --------------|
| -1 | -1 | -1            |
| -1 | +1 | -1            |
| +1 | -1 | -1            |
| +1 | +1 | +1            |

**Note:** Using bipolar (-1, +1) instead of binary (0, 1) for better learning.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Initialize Weights and Bias**

```
w₁ = 0
w₂ = 0
b = 0
```

**Step 2: Training with Pattern 1 (x₁=-1, x₂=-1, y=-1)**

```
Calculate weight updates:
Δw₁ = x₁ × y = (-1) × (-1) = 1
Δw₂ = x₂ × y = (-1) × (-1) = 1
Δb = y = -1

Update weights:
w₁ = 0 + 1 = 1
w₂ = 0 + 1 = 1
b = 0 + (-1) = -1
```

**Step 3: Training with Pattern 2 (x₁=-1, x₂=+1, y=-1)**

```
Calculate weight updates:
Δw₁ = x₁ × y = (-1) × (-1) = 1
Δw₂ = x₂ × y = (+1) × (-1) = -1
Δb = y = -1

Update weights:
w₁ = 1 + 1 = 2
w₂ = 1 + (-1) = 0
b = -1 + (-1) = -2
```

**Step 4: Training with Pattern 3 (x₁=+1, x₂=-1, y=-1)**

```
Calculate weight updates:
Δw₁ = x₁ × y = (+1) × (-1) = -1
Δw₂ = x₂ × y = (-1) × (-1) = 1
Δb = y = -1

Update weights:
w₁ = 2 + (-1) = 1
w₂ = 0 + 1 = 1
b = -2 + (-1) = -3
```

**Step 5: Training with Pattern 4 (x₁=+1, x₂=+1, y=+1)**

```
Calculate weight updates:
Δw₁ = x₁ × y = (+1) × (+1) = 1
Δw₂ = x₂ × y = (+1) × (+1) = 1
Δb = y = +1

Update weights:
w₁ = 1 + 1 = 2
w₂ = 1 + 1 = 2
b = -3 + 1 = -2
```

**Final Learned Weights:**

```
w₁ = 2
w₂ = 2
b = -2
```

**Training Summary Table:**

| Pattern | x₁ | x₂ | y | Δw₁ | Δw₂ | Δb | w₁ | w₂ | b  |
|---------|----|----|---|-----|-----|----|----|----|----|
| Initial | -  | -  | - | -   | -   | -  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 1       | -1 | -1 |-1 | 1   | 1   | -1 | 1  | 1  | -1 |
| 2       | -1 | +1 |-1 | 1   | -1  | -1 | 2  | 0  | -2 |
| 3       | +1 | -1 |-1 | -1  | 1   | -1 | 1  | 1  | -3 |
| 4       | +1 | +1 |+1 | 1   | 1   | +1 | 2  | 2  | -2 |

**Step 6: Testing**

Now let's test with all input patterns:

**Test 1: x₁ = -1, x₂ = -1**
```
y_in = (x₁ × w₁) + (x₂ × w₂) + b
y_in = (-1 × 2) + (-1 × 2) + (-2)
y_in = -2 + (-2) + (-2)
y_in = -6

Since y_in < 0 → y = -1 ✓ (Correct!)
```

**Test 2: x₁ = -1, x₂ = +1**
```
y_in = (-1 × 2) + (+1 × 2) + (-2)
y_in = -2 + 2 + (-2)
y_in = -2

Since y_in < 0 → y = -1 ✓ (Correct!)
```

**Test 3: x₁ = +1, x₂ = -1**
```
y_in = (+1 × 2) + (-1 × 2) + (-2)
y_in = 2 + (-2) + (-2)
y_in = -2

Since y_in < 0 → y = -1 ✓ (Correct!)
```

**Test 4: x₁ = +1, x₂ = +1**
```
y_in = (+1 × 2) + (+1 × 2) + (-2)
y_in = 2 + 2 + (-2)
y_in = 2

Since y_in > 0 → y = +1 ✓ (Correct!)
```

**Testing Results Table:**

| x₁ | x₂ | w₁×x₁ | w₂×x₂ | b  | y_in | y (output) | Expected | Result |
|----|----| ------|-------|----|------|------------|----------|--------|
| -1 | -1 | -2    | -2    | -2 | -6   | -1         | -1       | ✓      |
| -1 | +1 | -2    | +2    | -2 | -2   | -1         | -1       | ✓      |
| +1 | -1 | +2    | -2    | -2 | -2   | -1         | -1       | ✓      |
| +1 | +1 | +2    | +2    | -2 | +2   | +1         | +1       | ✓      |

**Conclusion:** The Hebb network successfully learned the AND function! All test cases pass.

---

### **3.3 Perceptron Learning Algorithm**

**Training Algorithm:**

```
Step 1: Initialize
    Set weights to small random values or 0
    Set learning rate α (typically 0.1 to 1)
    Set bias b = 0

Step 2: For each training pattern (x, t):
    Step 2a: Calculate output
        y_in = Σ(xᵢ × wᵢ) + b
        y = f(y_in)  [Apply activation function]
    
    Step 2b: Calculate error
        error = t - y
        (t = target/desired output)
    
    Step 2c: Update weights (only if error ≠ 0)
        If error ≠ 0:
            wᵢ(new) = wᵢ(old) + α × error × xᵢ
            b(new) = b(old) + α × error

Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until:
    - All patterns classified correctly, OR
    - Maximum epochs (dataset passes) reached

Step 4: Return learned weights
```

**Weight Update Rule:**

```
Δwᵢ = α × (t - y) × xᵢ

Where:
- α = learning rate (controls step size)
- t = target output (desired)
- y = actual output (predicted)
- xᵢ = input value
```

**Key Difference from Hebb:**

| Aspect | Hebb Rule | Perceptron Rule |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Update | Always | Only on error |
| Formula | Δw = x × y | Δw = α × (t-y) × x |
| Error Correction | No | Yes |
| Convergence | Not guaranteed | Guaranteed (if linearly separable) |

## **Section 4: Linear Separability**

### **4.1 What is Linear Separability?**

> PYQ: Illustrate the concept of linear separability with the solution of the OR function. (2024, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Explain Linear Separability Concept by taking a suitable example, also classify the output of OR function using it. (2022, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Linear Separability (2024, 2.5 marks)

**Definition:**

**Linear Separability** means that two classes of data points can be separated by a straight line (in 2D), a plane (in 3D), or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions).

**Simple Explanation:**

Imagine you have red dots and green dots on a paper. If you can draw a straight line that puts all red dots on one side and all green dots on the other side, then the data is linearly separable. Otherwise, it is non-linearly separable.

![Linear Separability](https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.TU1l7Tg22S6JTkcj6_Mc2AHaC4)

**Mathematical Definition:**

A dataset is linearly separable if there exists a hyperplane:
```
w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ + b = 0
```
such that:
- For class +1: w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ + b > 0
- For class -1: w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ + b < 0

---

### **4.2 Geometric Interpretation**

A **decision boundary** separates the two classes. In 2D space, this boundary is a straight line; in 3D, it's a plane; and in higher dimensions, it's called a hyperplane.

**2D Example:**

```
      x₂
       ↑
    +1 |    ○         ○  (Class +1)
       |       
       |  ╱ Decision Boundary
     0 | ╱
       |╱
   -1  |●         ●      (Class -1)
       └──────────────→ x₁
      -1    0    +1
```

**Decision Boundary Equation:**

```
w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + b = 0

This is a straight line in 2D
```

**Classification Rule:**

```
Bipolar Representation:
If w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + b > 0 → Class +1 (●)
If w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + b < 0 → Class -1 (○)

OR

Binary Representation:
If w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + b ≥ 0 → Class 1 (●)
If w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + b < 0 → Class 0 (○)
```

> **Note:** We will be using bipolar representation (+1, -1) instead of binary (0, 1) because the Perceptron uses the Signum activation function which outputs -1 or +1, and bipolar values provide better mathematical properties for weight updates during learning. However, binary (0, 1) representation can also be used with appropriate activation functions like the threshold function.

### **4.3 Linear Separability of Logic Functions**

**AND Function (Linearly Separable):**

AND output is +1 when both inputs are +1, otherwise -1.

```
Truth Table:
x₁  x₂  | y
-1  -1  | -1  ●
-1  +1  | -1  ●
+1  -1  | -1  ●
+1  +1  | +1  ○

Plot:
      x₂
       ↑
    +1 |    ●         ○
       |       ╱
       |     ╱
     0 |   ╱
       | ╱
   -1  |●         ●
       └──────────────→ x₁
      -1    0    +1

Decision Line: x₁ + x₂ = 1
Can separate! ✓
```

**OR Function (Linearly Separable):**

OR output is +1 when at least one input is +1, otherwise -1.

```
Truth Table:
x₁  x₂  | y
-1  -1  | -1  ●
-1  +1  | +1  ○
+1  -1  | +1  ○
+1  +1  | +1  ○

Plot:
      x₂
       ↑
    +1 |    ○         ○
       |   ╱
       | ╱
     0 |╱
       |
   -1  |●
       └──────────────→ x₁
      -1    0    +1

Decision Line: x₁ + x₂ = 0
Can separate! ✓
```

**XOR Function (NOT Linearly Separable):**

XOR output is +1 when the inputs are different, otherwise -1.

```
Truth Table:
x₁  x₂  | y
-1  -1  | -1  ●
-1  +1  | +1  ○
+1  -1  | +1  ○
+1  +1  | -1  ●

Plot:
      x₂
       ↑
    +1 |    ○         ●
       |
       |
     0 |
       |
   -1  |●         ○
       └──────────────→ x₁
      -1    0    +1

Cannot draw a single line to separate! ✗
This is why single-layer perceptron fails on XOR!
```

### **4.4 Solution of OR Function using Linear Separability**

> PYQ: Solution of OR function using linear separability model (2024, 2022, 15 marks)

**Step 1: Plot the Data Points**

```
OR Function (Bipolar):
(-1, -1) → -1  [Point A: Class -1]
(-1, +1) → +1  [Point B: Class +1]
(+1, -1) → +1  [Point C: Class +1]
(+1, +1) → +1  [Point D: Class +1]

Plot:
      x₂
       ↑
    +1 | B(○)      D(○)
       |
       |
     0 |
       |
   -1  | A(●)      C(○)
       └────────────────→ x₁
      -1    0     +1
```

**Step 2: Find Decision Boundary**

We need a line that separates:
- Class -1 (only point A)
- Class +1 (points B, C, D)

**Try the line: x₁ + x₂ = 0**

```
For point A (-1, -1):
x₁ + x₂ = -1 + (-1) = -2 < 0 ✓ (Class -1)

For point B (-1, +1):
x₁ + x₂ = -1 + 1 = 0 ≥ 0 ✓ (Class +1)

For point C (+1, -1):
x₁ + x₂ = 1 + (-1) = 0 ≥ 0 ✓ (Class +1)

For point D (+1, +1):
x₁ + x₂ = 1 + 1 = 2 > 0 ✓ (Class +1)
```

**Decision Boundary Found!**

```
Equation: x₁ + x₂ = 0
Or: w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + b = 0

Where: w₁ = 1, w₂ = 1, b = 0
```

**Step 3: Classification Rule**

```
If x₁ + x₂ ≥ 0 → Output = +1
If x₁ + x₂ < 0 → Output = -1
```

**Step 4: Verification**

| x₁ | x₂ | x₁+x₂ | Output | Expected | Result |
|----|----| ------|--------|----------|--------|
| -1 | -1 | -2    | -1     | -1       | ✓      |
| -1 | +1 | 0     | +1     | +1       | ✓      |
| +1 | -1 | 0     | +1     | +1       | ✓      |
| +1 | +1 | 2     | +1     | +1       | ✓      |

**Conclusion:** OR function is linearly separable with decision boundary x₁ + x₂ = 0.

### **4.5 Why XOR is Not Linearly Separable**

**XOR Truth Table:**

| x₁ | x₂ | y |
|----|----|---|
| 0  | 0  | 0 |
| 0  | 1  | 1 |
| 1  | 0  | 1 |
| 1  | 1  | 0 |

**Problem:**

```
Plot:
      x₂
       ↑
     1 |    ○         ●
       |
       |
     0 |●         ○
       └──────────────→ x₁
       0    1

○ = Class 1 (output = 1)
● = Class 0 (output = 0)

No single straight line can separate these!
```

**Why Single-Layer Networks Fail:**

- Single-layer perceptron can only learn linearly separable functions
- XOR requires a curved or multiple decision boundaries
- This limitation led to the "AI Winter" in the 1970s
- Solution: Multi-layer networks (covered in Unit 3)

---

### **4.6 Testing for Linear Separability**

**Methods to Check:**

**1. Visual Method (2D):**
- Plot the points
- Try to draw a straight line
- If possible → linearly separable

**2. Analytical Method:**
- Try to find weights w and bias b
- Such that all points are correctly classified
- If found → linearly separable

**3. Computational Method:**
- Train a perceptron
- If it converges → linearly separable
- If it doesn't converge → not linearly separable
