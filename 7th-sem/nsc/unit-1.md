## **1. Basic Concepts**

> PYQ: Define plain-text and cipher-text. How are they related in encryption? (2024, 2.5 marks)

### 1.1 Plain Text and Cipher Text

**Plain Text** is the original message or data that we want to keep safe. It is easy to read and understand by anyone. Examples of plain text are text files, emails, or passwords before they are protected.

**Cipher Text** is the scrambled, unreadable version of plain text after it has been encrypted. It looks like random letters or numbers and cannot be understood without the secret key. Turning plain text into cipher text keeps the information safe, even if someone else gets it during transmission.

**Relationship in Encryption:**

```
Plain Text ──[Encryption Algorithm + Key]──> Cipher Text
Cipher Text ──[Decryption Algorithm + Key]──> Plain Text
```

### 1.2 Cryptography

**Cryptography** is the study of how to keep information safe by converting it into a form that others cannot read. It uses different methods to protect messages so that only the right people can understand them, even if someone else tries to see them. Cryptography makes sure our data stays private, correct, and only comes from trusted sources. The word comes from Greek: "kryptos" means hidden and "graphein" means writing, so it means "hidden writing."

#### Goals of Cryptography:

- **Confidentiality**: Keeping information secret from unauthorized people.
- **Integrity**: Ensuring information is not changed or tampered with.
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of the sender and receiver.
- **Access Control**: Restricting who can access certain information.
- **Non-repudiation**: Preventing someone from denying they sent a message.

### 1.3 Cryptanalysis

> PYQ: Cryptanalysis (May-23, 2.5 marks)

**Cryptanalysis** is the science of breaking cryptographic systems and recovering the plain text or key without having authorized access. It involves analyzing encryption algorithms to find weaknesses that can be exploited. Cryptanalysis techniques include brute force attacks, frequency analysis, known-plaintext attacks, chosen-plaintext attacks, and differential cryptanalysis.

**Types of Cryptanalytic Attacks:**

- **Ciphertext-only attack**: Attacker has only cipher text
- **Known-plaintext attack**: Attacker has some plaintext-ciphertext pairs
- **Chosen-plaintext attack**: Attacker can choose plaintexts and get corresponding ciphertexts
- **Chosen-ciphertext attack**: Attacker can choose ciphertexts and get corresponding plaintexts

## **2. Encryption and Decryption**

> PYQ: Encryption and Decryption with examples. (May-23, 8 marks)  
> PYQ: Describe the process of symmetric key cryptography and explain the role of encryption and decryption keys in the process. (2024, 15 marks)

### 2.1 What is Encryption?

**Encryption** is the process of converting plain text into cipher text using an encryption algorithm and a key. The purpose is to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access during storage or transmission. Only authorized parties with the correct decryption key can convert the cipher text back to its original form.

**Encryption Process:**

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Plain Text │────>│   Encryption     │────>│ Cipher Text │
│   (Input)   │     │   Algorithm      │     │  (Output)   │
└─────────────┘     └────────┬─────────┘     └─────────────┘
                             │
                        ┌────▼────┐
                        │   Key   │
                        └─────────┘
```

### 2.2 What is Decryption?

**Decryption** is the reverse process of encryption, where cipher text is converted back to plain text using a decryption algorithm and the appropriate key. Only authorized users who possess the correct key can decrypt the cipher text and access the original information.

**Decryption Process:**

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Cipher Text │────>│   Decryption     │────>│  Plain Text │
│   (Input)   │     │   Algorithm      │     │  (Output)   │
└─────────────┘     └────────┬─────────┘     └─────────────┘
                             │
                        ┌────▼────┐
                        │   Key   │
                        └─────────┘
```

### 2.3 Example: Caesar Cipher

**Encryption Example:**

- Plain Text: "HELLO"
- Key: Shift by 3
- Encryption: Each letter shifted 3 positions forward
  - H → K, E → H, L → O, L → O, O → R
- Cipher Text: "KHOOR"

**Decryption Example:**

- Cipher Text: "KHOOR"
- Key: Shift by 3
- Decryption: Each letter shifted 3 positions backward
  - K → H, H → E, O → L, O → L, R → O
- Plain Text: "HELLO"

## **3. Symmetric Key Cryptography**

> PYQ: Describe the process of symmetric key cryptography and explain the role of encryption and decryption keys in the process. (2024, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Problem of key distribution in symmetric cryptography. (Dec-22, 7 marks)

### 3.1 What is Symmetric Key Cryptography?

**Symmetric Key Cryptography** is an encryption method where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Both the sender and receiver must possess the same secret key and keep it confidential. This approach is also called secret-key cryptography or private-key cryptography. It is faster and more efficient than asymmetric cryptography, making it suitable for encrypting large amounts of data.

**Example:**

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** Used to encrypt files on your computer, secure data in mobile apps, and protect information in Wi-Fi networks.

**Process:**

```
Sender Side:                 Receiver Side:
┌─────────────┐             ┌─────────────┐
│  Plain Text │             │ Cipher Text │
└──────┬──────┘             └──────┬──────┘
       │  ┌──────────────┐         │
       └─>│  Encryption  │         │
          │  (Same Key)  │         │
          └──────┬───────┘         │
                 |                 │
          ┌──────▼───────┐         │
          │ Cipher Text  │─────────┘
          └──────────────┘         │
                            ┌──────▼───────┐
                            │  Decryption  │
                            │  (Same Key)  │
                            └──────┬───────┘
                                   │
                            ┌──────▼──────┐
                            │  Plain Text │
                            └─────────────┘
```

### 3.2 Role of Keys in Symmetric Cryptography

**Encryption Key Role:**

- Transforms plain text into cipher text
- Must be kept secret from unauthorized users
- Determines the specific transformation applied
- Same key used by sender

**Decryption Key Role:**

- Transforms cipher text back to plain text
- Identical to the encryption key
- Must be securely shared between sender and receiver
- Same key used by receiver

### 3.3 Key Distribution Problem

**The Challenge:**

The main problem with Symmetric Cryptography is the key distribution problem. Both the sender and receiver must have the same secret key, and sharing this key securely is difficult. If someone else gets the key during transmission, they can read all the messages. Managing and sharing keys becomes even harder as the number of users increases.

**Problems:**

- How to securely share the key initially?
- Risk of interception during key transmission
- Need for secure channel before secure communication
- Key management becomes complex with multiple users
- For n users, need n(n-1)/2 keys for pairwise communication

**Solutions:**

- Key Distribution Centers (KDC)
- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
- Using asymmetric cryptography for key exchange
- Physical key exchange through trusted courier
- Pre-shared keys during secure setup

### 3.4 Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

- Fast encryption and decryption
- Efficient for large data volumes
- Simple implementation
- Less computational overhead
- Suitable for real-time applications

**Disadvantages:**

- Key distribution problem
- Not scalable for large networks
- No non-repudiation
- Key management complexity
- Requires secure channel for key exchange

## **4. Asymmetric Key Cryptography**

> PYQ: Discuss the challenges and benefits of asymmetric key cryptography over symmetric key cryptography. Provide real-world examples to illustrate their usage. (2024, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Role of session key in public key schemes (Feb-22, 2.5 marks)

### 4.1 What is Asymmetric Key Cryptography?

**Asymmetric Key Cryptography** is an encryption method that uses two different but mathematically related keys - a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key can be freely distributed to anyone, while the private key must be kept secret by the owner. This approach is also called public-key cryptography and solves the key distribution problem of symmetric cryptography.

**Example:**

- **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman):** Used for secure website connections (HTTPS), digital signatures, and encrypting emails.

**Process:**

```
Sender Side:                 Receiver Side:
┌─────────────┐             ┌─────────────┐
│  Plain Text │             │ Cipher Text │
└──────┬──────┘             └──────┬──────┘
       │                           │
       │  ┌──────────────┐         │
       └─>│  Encryption  │         │
          │ (Public Key) │         │
          └──────┬───────┘         │
                 │                 │
          ┌──────▼───────┐         │
          │ Cipher Text  │─────────┘
          └──────────────┘         │
                            ┌──────▼───────┐
                            │  Decryption  │
                            │ (Private Key)|
                            └──────┬───────┘
                                   │
                            ┌──────▼──────┐
                            │  Plain Text │
                            └─────────────┘
```

### 4.2 Challenges of Asymmetric Cryptography

**Technical Challenges:**

- **Computational Overhead**: Much slower than symmetric encryption (100-1000 times)
- **Key Size**: Requires larger key sizes (2048-4096 bits) for equivalent security
- **Resource Intensive**: High CPU and memory requirements
- **Not Suitable for Large Data**: Inefficient for encrypting large files

**Management Challenges:**

- **Certificate Management**: Need for Certificate Authorities (CA)
- **Key Revocation**: Handling compromised keys
- **Trust Issues**: Verifying public key authenticity
- **Implementation Complexity**: More complex algorithms

### 4.3 Benefits of Asymmetric Cryptography

**Over Symmetric Cryptography:**

- **No Key Distribution Problem**: Public key can be shared openly
- **Scalability**: For n users, only need 2n keys (not n(n-1)/2)
- **Digital Signatures**: Provides authentication and non-repudiation
- **Key Management**: Easier to manage in large networks
- **No Pre-shared Secret**: No need for secure initial key exchange

**Security Benefits:**

- Private key never transmitted
- Provides confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation
- Enables secure communication with unknown parties
- Foundation for PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)

### 4.4 Real-World Examples

**Asymmetric Cryptography:**

- **SSL/TLS (HTTPS)**: Secure web browsing uses RSA for key exchange
- **Email Encryption**: PGP/GPG for secure email communication
- **Digital Signatures**: PDF signing, code signing, document authentication
- **SSH**: Secure remote server access
- **Cryptocurrency**: Bitcoin uses elliptic curve cryptography
- **VPN**: Initial authentication and key exchange

**Symmetric Cryptography:**

- **File Encryption**: BitLocker, VeraCrypt for disk encryption
- **Database Encryption**: AES for encrypting stored data
- **Video Streaming**: Netflix, YouTube use AES for content protection
- **Mobile Communication**: 4G/5G networks use AES
- **Banking**: ATM transactions use DES/3DES

### 4.5 Hybrid Approach

**Best of Both Worlds:**

Most real-world systems use both:

1. **Asymmetric** for secure key exchange and authentication
2. **Symmetric** for actual data encryption (faster)

**Example: WhatsApp End-to-End Encryption**

- Uses asymmetric encryption to exchange session keys
- Uses symmetric encryption (AES) for message encryption

### 4.6 Role of Session Key

> PYQ: Role of session key in public key schemes (Feb-22, 2.5 marks)

**Session Key** is a temporary symmetric key used for encrypting data during a single communication session. In public key schemes, asymmetric cryptography is used to securely exchange the session key, and then symmetric cryptography (using the session key) encrypts the actual data.

**Why Use Session Keys?**

- Combines security of asymmetric with speed of symmetric encryption
- Reduces computational overhead
- Limits damage if key is compromised (temporary key)
- New key for each session enhances security

## **5. Substitution Techniques**

> PYQ: Four substitution techniques – merits/demerits. (Feb-22, 10 marks)  
> PYQ: Substitution techniques with examples. (May-23, 10 marks)  
> PYQ: What is the difference between substitution and transposition techniques in cryptography? (2024, 2.5 marks)

### 5.1 What are Substitution Techniques?

**Substitution Technique** is a method of encryption where each element of the plain text (such as a letter, bit, or group of bits) is replaced with another element from a fixed system. The order of the elements remains the same, but their identity changes. This is one of the oldest and most fundamental encryption methods.

Examples of substitution techniques include Caesar cipher, monoalphabetic cipher, polyalphabetic cipher (like Vigenère), and homophonic substitution cipher.

### 5.2 Caesar Cipher (Shift Cipher)

**Description:**

The simplest substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

**Algorithm:**

```
Encryption: C = (P + K) mod 26
Decryption: P = (C - K) mod 26

Where:
C = Cipher text letter position
P = Plain text letter position
K = Key (shift value)
```

**Example (K=3):**

```
Plain Text:  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Cipher Text: D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C

Plain Text:  HELLO
Cipher Text: KHOOR
```

**Merits:**

- Extremely simple to implement
- Easy to understand
- Fast encryption/decryption
- No complex computations required

**Demerits:**

- Only 25 possible keys (very weak)
- Vulnerable to brute force attack
- Easily broken by frequency analysis
- Not secure for modern use

### 5.3 Monoalphabetic Cipher

**Description:**

A substitution cipher where each letter of the alphabet is mapped to another letter using a fixed substitution table. Unlike Caesar cipher, the mapping is random rather than a simple shift.

**Example:**

```
Plain Text:  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Cipher Text: Q W E R T Y U I O P A S D F G H J K L Z X C V B N M

Plain Text:  HELLO
Cipher Text: ITSSG
```

**Key Space:** 26! ≈ 4 × 10²⁶ possible keys

**Merits:**

- Large key space (26! combinations)
- More secure than Caesar cipher
- Simple implementation
- One-to-one mapping

**Demerits:**

- Vulnerable to frequency analysis
- Letter patterns preserved
- Statistical properties of language remain
- Can be broken with sufficient cipher text

### 5.4 Polyalphabetic Cipher (Vigenère Cipher)

> PYQ: Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher. (Dec-22, 5 marks)

**Description:**

A substitution cipher that uses multiple substitution alphabets. Different letters in the plain text may be encrypted differently depending on their position. This makes frequency analysis much harder.

**Algorithm:**

```
Encryption: Cᵢ = (Pᵢ + Kᵢ) mod 26
Decryption: Pᵢ = (Cᵢ - Kᵢ) mod 26

Where:
Kᵢ = K[i mod key_length]
```

**Example:**

Suppose you want to encrypt the word **"HELLO"** using the key **"KEY"**.

1. Write the key repeatedly under the plain text:
   ```
   Plain Text: H E L L O
   Key:        K E Y K E
   ```
2. Convert letters to numbers (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25):
   ```
   H=7, E=4, L=11, L=11, O=14
   K=10, E=4, Y=24, K=10, E=4
   ```
3. Add the numbers (mod 26):
   ```
   (7+10)=17 (R), (4+4)=8 (I), (11+24)=35→9 (J), (11+10)=21 (V), (14+4)=18 (S)
   ```
4. Convert back to letters:
   ```
   Cipher Text: R I J V S
   ```

**Vigenère Table:**

```
    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
A | A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
B | B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A
C | C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B
... (each row shifted by one)
```

**Merits:**

- Resistant to frequency analysis
- Multiple substitution alphabets
- Stronger than monoalphabetic ciphers
- Variable key length increases security

**Demerits:**

- Vulnerable to Kasiski examination
- Can be broken if key length is known
- Repeating key pattern is a weakness
- Not secure against modern cryptanalysis

### 5.5 Homophonic Substitution Cipher

> PYQ: Homophonic Substitution Cipher (Dec-22, 2.5 marks)

**Description:**

A **Homophonic Substitution Cipher** is a substitution cipher where each plain text letter can be replaced by any one of several possible cipher symbols. This means common letters (like E or T) can have many different codes, making it harder to break the cipher using letter frequency.

**Example:**

Suppose:

- The letter **E** can be replaced by 12, 45, or 99
- The letter **T** can be replaced by 23 or 56
- The letter **A** can be replaced by 31 or 77

If you want to encrypt the word **"EAT"**, you could choose:

- E → 45
- A → 77
- T → 23

So, **"EAT"** becomes **"45 77 23"** (but next time, you could use different numbers for the same letters).

**Merits:**

- Defeats simple frequency analysis
- Flattens frequency distribution
- More secure than monoalphabetic
- Multiple representations for common letters

**Demerits:**

- Requires larger cipher text (more symbols)
- Complex key management
- Still vulnerable to advanced cryptanalysis
- Digram and trigram analysis can break it

### 5.6 Comparison Table

| Technique      | Key Space | Security  | Frequency Analysis | Complexity |
| -------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Caesar         | 25        | Very Weak | Vulnerable         | Very Low   |
| Monoalphabetic | 26!       | Weak      | Vulnerable         | Low        |
| Polyalphabetic | 26^m      | Moderate  | Resistant          | Medium     |
| Homophonic     | Large     | Moderate  | Resistant          | Medium     |

## **6. Transposition Techniques**

> PYQ: Transposition techniques. (Feb-22, 5 marks)  
> PYQ: Transposition techniques with examples. (Dec-22, 8 marks)  
> PYQ: What is the difference between substitution and transposition techniques in cryptography? (2024, 2.5 marks)

### 6.1 What are Transposition Techniques?

**Transposition Technique** is a method of encryption where the positions of the plain text characters are rearranged according to a specific system. Unlike substitution, the characters themselves remain unchanged, but their order is scrambled. This technique is also called permutation cipher.

**Key Difference from Substitution:**

- **Substitution**: Changes the identity of characters (A → D)
- **Transposition**: Changes the position of characters (HELLO → LOHEL)

Examples of transposition techniques include Rail Fence cipher, columnar transposition, and double transposition.

### 6.2 Rail Fence Cipher

> PYQ: Rail-Fence Technique (May-23, 2.5 marks)

**Description:**

The plain text is written in a zigzag pattern across multiple rails (rows), and the cipher text is read row by row.

**Example (2 Rails):**

```
Plain Text: CRYPTOGRAPHY

Rail 1: C . Y . T . G . A . H
Rail 2: . R . P . O . R . P . Y

Cipher Text: CYTGAHRPORPY
```

**Example (3 Rails):**

```
Plain Text: HELLOWORLD

Writing Pattern:
Rail 1: H . . . O . . . L .
Rail 2: . E . L . W . R . D
Rail 3: . . L . . . O . . .

Cipher Text: HOLELWRDLO
```

**Algorithm:**

1. Write plain text in zigzag pattern across n rails
2. Read cipher text row by row from top to bottom

**Decryption:**

1. Calculate positions for each rail
2. Fill rails with cipher text characters
3. Read in zigzag pattern to get plain text

**Merits:**

- Simple to implement
- Fast encryption
- No complex calculations
- Easy to understand

**Demerits:**

- Weak security
- Pattern can be detected
- Small key space (number of rails)
- Vulnerable to brute force

### 6.3 Columnar Transposition

**Description:**

Plain text is written row by row in a grid, and cipher text is read column by column in an order determined by a key.

**Example:**

```
Key: 4 3 1 2 5
Plain Text (no spaces): HELLOWORLDCRYPTOGRAPHY

Grid (5 columns, 5 rows, pad with dots):
   4  3  1  2  5
   -------------
   H  E  L  L  O
   W  O  R  L  D
   C  R  Y  P  T
   O  G  R  A  P
   H  Y  .  .  .

Column reading order (sorted key):
1 → column 3: L R Y R .
2 → column 4: L L P A .
3 → column 2: E O R G Y
4 → column 1: H W C O H
5 → column 5: O D T P .

Cipher Text: LRYRLLPAEORGYHWCHOODTP
```

**Algorithm:**

1. Arrange plain text in rows of fixed length
2. Determine column order using key
3. Read columns in key order to get cipher text

**Merits:**

- More secure than rail fence
- Variable key increases security
- Can use multiple rounds
- Preserves letter frequency (harder to detect)

**Demerits:**

- Vulnerable to known-plaintext attack
- Pattern analysis can reveal structure
- Requires padding for incomplete rows
- Not secure against modern attacks

### 6.4 Double Transposition

**Description:**

Applies columnar transposition twice with different keys for enhanced security.

**Process:**

```
Plain Text → [Transposition with Key1] → Intermediate Text
Intermediate Text → [Transposition with Key2] → Cipher Text
```

**Example:**

```
Plain Text: HELLO
Key1: 3 1 2
Key2: 2 3 1

Step 1: First Transposition (Key1: 3 1 2)
Fill the grid (3 columns):
   3 1 2
   -----
   H E L
   L O .

Now, read columns in key order (1, 2, 3):
Column 1 (1): E O
Column 2 (2): L .
Column 3 (3): H L

Intermediate text (column-wise): E O L H L (ignore the dot for simplicity)

Step 2: Second Transposition (Key2: 2 3 1)
Arrange E O L H L in 3 columns (2 3 1):
   2 3 1
   -----
   E O L
   H L .

Read columns in key order (1, 2, 3):
Column 1 (1): L .
Column 2 (2): E H
Column 3 (3): O L

Final cipher text (column-wise): L E O H L (ignore the dot)

Cipher Text: LEOHL
```

**Merits:**

- Much stronger than single transposition
- Two keys increase complexity
- Difficult to break without both keys
- Used in historical military communications

**Demerits:**

- Slower than single transposition
- Requires two keys
- Still vulnerable to advanced cryptanalysis
- Not suitable for modern security needs

### 6.5 Comparison: Substitution vs Transposition

## **7. Block Cipher Design Principles**

> PYQ: Design principles of block cipher. (Feb-22, 8 marks)

### 7.1 What is a Block Cipher?

**Block Cipher** is a symmetric encryption method that processes fixed-size blocks of data (typically 64 or 128 bits) at a time. It transforms each block of plain text into a block of cipher text using a secret key. Modern encryption standards like DES (Data Encryption Standard) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) are block ciphers.

Example includes DES, AES, Blowfish, and Twofish.

### 7.2 Feistel Cipher Structure

> PYQ: Feistel Cipher (Feb-22, 2.5 marks)

**Feistel Cipher** is a symmetric structure used in many block cipher designs where encryption and decryption processes are almost identical. The plain text block is divided into two halves, and multiple rounds of processing are applied using subkeys derived from the main key.

**Structure:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Input Block (64-bit)        │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
      ┌──────┴──────┐
   Left (L₀)    Right (R₀)
      │             │
      │      ┌──────┴──────┐
      │      │  Function F │
      │      │   (Key K₁)  │
      │      └──────┬──────┘
      └─────⊕──────┘
            │
         (L₁, R₁)
            │
      (Multiple Rounds)
            │
      ┌─────┴─────┐
    Left       Right
      └─────┬─────┘
            │
┌───────────▼─────────────────────────┐
│         Output Block (64-bit)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Round Function:**

```
Lᵢ = Rᵢ₋₁
Rᵢ = Lᵢ₋₁ ⊕ F(Rᵢ₋₁, Kᵢ)

Where:
⊕ = XOR operation
F = Round function
Kᵢ = Round key
```

**Working Principle**

1. The plaintext block is divided into two halves. Left half (L₀) and Right half (R₀).
2. For each round _i_:
   - **Step 1:** Set the left half for this round:  
     Lᵢ = Rᵢ₋₁
   - **Step 2:** Compute the right half for this round:  
     Rᵢ = Lᵢ₋₁ ⊕ F(Rᵢ₋₁, Kᵢ)  
     where F is the round function and Kᵢ is the round key.
3. After the final round, the two halves are combined to produce the ciphertext.

**Advantages:**

- Encryption and decryption are similar (same structure)
- Easy to implement
- Reversible regardless of F function
- Used in DES, Blowfish, Twofish

### 7.3 Design Principles

**1. Confusion:**

Makes the relationship between cipher text and key as complex as possible. An attacker should not be able to predict how changes in the key affect the cipher text.

**Implementation:**

- Substitution operations (S-boxes)
- Complex non-linear transformations
- Each bit of cipher text depends on multiple key bits

**2. Diffusion:**

Spreads the influence of one plain text bit over many cipher text bits. A small change in plain text should cause significant changes in cipher text.

**Implementation:**

- Permutation operations (P-boxes)
- Transposition
- Each plain text bit affects multiple cipher text bits

### 7.4 Avalanche Effect

> PYQ: Avalanche effect (Feb-22, 2.5 marks)

**Avalanche Effect** is a desirable property of cryptographic algorithms where a small change in the input (plain text or key) produces a significant change in the output (cipher text). Ideally, changing one bit in the input should change approximately 50% of the output bits.

**Example:**

```
Plain Text 1: 10110101 10110101
Key:          11001100 11001100
Cipher Text:  01101110 10011001

Plain Text 2: 10110100 10110101 (1 bit changed)
Key:          11001100 11001100
Cipher Text:  11010001 01100110 (8 bits changed)
```

**Importance:**

- Prevents pattern detection
- Makes cryptanalysis difficult
- Small input changes hide relationships
- Essential for strong encryption

### 7.5 Product Cipher

> PYQ: Product cipher (Dec-22, 2.5 marks)

**Product Cipher** is a cipher that combines two or more simple ciphers in sequence to achieve higher security. It typically combines substitution and transposition operations to achieve both confusion and diffusion.

**Types:**

- **Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN)**: Alternates substitution and permutation
- **Feistel Network**: Uses repeated rounds of function application

**Example:**

```
Plain Text → [Substitution] → [Transposition] → [Substitution] → Cipher Text
```

**Advantages:**

- Stronger than individual ciphers
- Achieves both confusion and diffusion
- Foundation of modern block ciphers
- Multiple rounds increase security

### 7.6 Key Design Principles Summary

- **Block Size**: Larger blocks increase security but reduce efficiency (64, 128, 256 bits)
- **Key Size**: Longer keys increase security (128, 192, 256 bits)
- **Number of Rounds**: More rounds increase security but reduce speed (16 for DES, 10-14 for AES)
- **Subkey Generation**: Complex key schedule prevents related-key attacks
- **Round Function**: Should be non-linear and provide confusion
- **Efficiency**: Balance between security and performance

## **8. Mathematical Foundations**

> PYQ: Fermat and Euler's theorem. (Feb-22, 7 marks)

### 8.1 Fermat's Little Theorem

**Statement:**

If p is a prime number and a is any integer not divisible by p, then:

**aᵖ⁻¹ ≡ 1 (mod p)**

Or equivalently: **aᵖ ≡ a (mod p)**

**Example:**

```
Let p = 7, a = 3

3⁷⁻¹ = 3⁶ = 729
729 mod 7 = 1

Therefore: 3⁶ ≡ 1 (mod 7) ✓
```

**Applications:**

- Primality testing
- RSA algorithm
- Modular exponentiation
- Cryptographic key generation

### 8.2 Euler's Theorem

**Euler's Totient Function φ(n):**

The count of positive integers less than n that are relatively prime to n (gcd = 1).

**Examples:**

```
φ(9) = 6    (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 are coprime to 9)
φ(10) = 4   (1, 3, 7, 9 are coprime to 10)
φ(p) = p-1  (if p is prime)
φ(p×q) = (p-1)(q-1)  (if p, q are prime)
```

**Euler's Theorem Statement:**

If a and n are relatively prime (gcd(a,n) = 1), then:

**aᶲ⁽ⁿ⁾ ≡ 1 (mod n)**

**Example:**

```
Let n = 10, a = 3
φ(10) = 4

3⁴ = 81
81 mod 10 = 1

Therefore: 3⁴ ≡ 1 (mod 10) ✓
```

**Relationship:**

- Fermat's theorem is a special case of Euler's theorem (when n is prime)
- Both are fundamental to RSA algorithm
- Used in modular arithmetic for cryptography

### 8.3 Application in RSA

**RSA Key Generation:**

```
1. Choose two primes: p, q
2. Calculate n = p × q
3. Calculate φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
4. Choose e such that gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1
5. Calculate d such that d×e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))

Public Key: (e, n)
Private Key: (d, n)
```

**Why Euler's Theorem Works in RSA:**

```
Encryption: C = Mᵉ mod n
Decryption: M = Cᵈ mod n

Proof: Cᵈ = (Mᵉ)ᵈ = Mᵉᵈ mod n

Since e×d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))
Therefore: e×d = 1 + k×φ(n)

Mᵉᵈ = M^(1+k×φ(n)) = M × (Mᶲ⁽ⁿ⁾)ᵏ

By Euler's theorem: Mᶲ⁽ⁿ⁾ ≡ 1 (mod n)

Therefore: M × 1ᵏ = M (Original message recovered!)
```

## **9. Key Exchange Algorithm**

> PYQ: Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm. (May-23, 7 marks)

### 9.1 Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

**Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** is a method for two parties to securely establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel without having met before. The security is based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms. This algorithm solves the key distribution problem in symmetric cryptography.

### 9.2 Algorithm Steps

**Public Parameters:**

- **p**: A large prime number
- **g**: A primitive root modulo p (generator)

Both p and g are publicly known.

**Process:**

```
Alice Side:                          Bob Side:
1. Choose private key: a            1. Choose private key: b
   (random number)                     (random number)

2. Calculate public key:            2. Calculate public key:
   A = gᵃ mod p                        B = gᵇ mod p

3. Send A to Bob ──────────────────> Receive A

4. Receive B <────────────────────── Send B to Alice

5. Calculate shared secret:         5. Calculate shared secret:
   S = Bᵃ mod p                        S = Aᵇ mod p

Both have same secret: S = gᵃᵇ mod p
```

### 9.3 Example

**Given:**

```
p = 23 (prime)
g = 5 (primitive root)
```

**Alice's Side:**

```
Private key: a = 6
Public key: A = 5⁶ mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8
Send A = 8 to Bob
```

**Bob's Side:**

```
Private key: b = 15
Public key: B = 5¹⁵ mod 23 = 30517578125 mod 23 = 19
Send B = 19 to Alice
```

**Shared Secret Calculation:**

**Alice computes:**

```
S = Bᵃ mod p = 19⁶ mod 23 = 47045881 mod 23 = 2
```

**Bob computes:**

```
S = Aᵇ mod p = 8¹⁵ mod 23 = 35184372088832 mod 23 = 2
```

**Shared Secret: S = 2** ✓

### 9.4 Security

**Why It's Secure:**

- Attacker can see: p, g, A, B
- Attacker needs to find: a or b
- This requires solving discrete logarithm problem: gᵃ = A (mod p)
- Computationally infeasible for large p (2048+ bits)

**Vulnerabilities:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack**: No authentication of parties
- **Small Subgroup Attack**: If g is not properly chosen
- **Weak Random Numbers**: If a or b are predictable

**Solutions:**

- Use authenticated Diffie-Hellman
- Digital signatures for authentication
- Strong random number generators
- Proper parameter selection

## **Quick Revision Points**

### **Key Concepts:**

- Plain text → original message; Cipher text → encrypted message
- Encryption uses key to convert plain text to cipher text
- Decryption reverses the process

### **Block Cipher Principles:**

- **Confusion**: Complex key-ciphertext relationship (S-boxes)
- **Diffusion**: Spread plaintext influence (P-boxes)
- **Avalanche**: 1-bit change → 50% output change
- **Product Cipher**: Combine substitution + transposition

### **Mathematical Foundations:**

- **Fermat**: aᵖ⁻¹ ≡ 1 (mod p) for prime p
- **Euler**: aᶲ⁽ⁿ⁾ ≡ 1 (mod n) for coprime a,n
- **φ(n)**: Count of numbers coprime to n
- Used in RSA algorithm

### **Diffie-Hellman:**

- Public: p (prime), g (generator)
- Private: a (Alice), b (Bob)
- Exchange: A = gᵃ mod p, B = gᵇ mod p
- Shared secret: S = gᵃᵇ mod p
