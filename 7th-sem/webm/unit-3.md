### 1.1 What is Computational Intelligence?

**Computational Intelligence (CI)** is a part of artificial intelligence that helps computers act smart in difficult and changing situations.

Instead of using strict rules and logic like traditional AI, CI uses ideas from nature - such as neural networks (like the brain), fuzzy systems (handling unclear information), and evolutionary algorithms (learning by trying and improving).

These methods work well for problems where things are uncertain or not clear, and where normal computer methods do not work well.

### 1.2 Key Characteristics

- **Learns and Adapts**: Improves itself based on experience.
- **Inspired by Nature**: Works like brains, animals, or plants.
- **Handles Uncertainty**: Works well even when things are unclear or noisy.
- **Works Together**: No single boss — many parts work together.
- **Simple Rules, Smart Results**: Follows easy rules to create complex behavior.

### 1.3 Components of Computational Intelligence

Components of Computational Intelligence are the main building blocks or types (like fuzzy systems, neural networks, evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence).

### 1.4 Computational Models of CI

Models are the specific ways these components work or are implemented (for example, a neural network model, a fuzzy logic model, a genetic algorithm model).

#### 1. Fuzzy Systems

**Concept:** Uses fuzzy logic to deal with information that is not clear or exact. It helps computers make decisions when things are uncertain or vague.

**Key Features:**

- **Linguistic Variables:** Describes inputs/outputs using terms like "hot," "cold," "medium" instead of precise numbers.
- **Membership Functions:** Assigns a degree of belonging (between 0 and 1) to each linguistic term, representing how true a statement is.
- **Fuzzy Rules (IF-THEN):** Uses rules such as "IF temperature is cold THEN heater is high" to make decisions based on imprecise information.

**Example:**

```
Temperature Control System:
IF temperature is COLD THEN heater is HIGH
IF temperature is WARM THEN heater is MEDIUM
IF temperature is HOT THEN heater is OFF
```

**Applications:**

- Air conditioning control
- Washing machine control
- Camera autofocus

#### 2. Neural Networks

**Concept:** Inspired by biological neurons of the brain, learns patterns from data. It learns patterns from examples and can recognize things (like images or sounds) by adjusting its connections based on what it sees.

**Key Features:**

- **Learns from Data:** Can automatically detect patterns and relationships in data.
- **Generalization:** Able to make predictions or recognize unseen data after training.
- **Nonlinear Mapping:** Can model complex, nonlinear relationships.
- **Parallel Processing:** Many neurons work together simultaneously.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Can handle noisy or incomplete data.

**Structure:**

```
Input Layer → Hidden Layers → Output Layer
    │              │              │
    ▼              ▼              ▼
  [x₁]           [h₁]           [y₁]
  [x₂]    →      [h₂]     →     [y₂]
  [x₃]           [h₃]           [y₃]
```

**Learning Process:**

1. Forward propagation (input → output)
2. Calculate error
3. Backpropagation (adjust weights)
4. Repeat until convergence

**Applications:**

- Image recognition
- Speech recognition
- Natural language processing

#### 3. Evolutionary Computation

**Concept:** Evolutionary computation is inspired by the process of biological evolution, using mechanisms such as selection (choosing the best solutions), crossover (combining parts of solutions), and mutation (introducing random changes) to evolve a population of candidate solutions toward optimality.

**Key Features:**

- **Population-based search:** Works with a group of solutions at once.
- **Stochastic operators:** Uses random processes (mutation, crossover) to explore new solutions.
- **Selection pressure:** Favors better solutions for reproduction.
- **Adaptation:** Solutions improve over generations.

**Process:**

```
Initialize Population
    │
    ▼
Evaluate Fitness
    │
    ▼
Selection (best individuals)
    │
    ▼
Crossover (combine solutions)
    │
    ▼
Mutation (random changes)
    │
    ▼
New Generation
    │
    └──► Repeat until optimal solution
```

**Applications:**

- Optimization problems
- Scheduling
- Design optimization

#### 4. Swarm Intelligence

**Concept:** Swarm intelligence means many simple agents (like ants or birds) work together without a leader. Each agent follows simple rules and interacts with others nearby. Their combined actions create smart group behavior that solves problems, even though each agent is not smart on its own.

In this context, a "swarm" means a group of simple agents (like birds, ants, bees, or fish) that work together without a leader.

**Key Features:**

- **Decentralized Control**: No central leader; each agent acts independently.
- **Simple Local Rules**: Agents follow basic rules based on local information.
- **Self-Organization**: Order and patterns emerge from agent interactions.
- **Flexibility**: Adapts to changes in environment or problem.
- **Robustness**: System works even if some agents fail.
- **Parallelism**: Many agents search for solutions at the same time.

**Examples:**

- Ant colonies finding shortest path
- Bird flocks coordinating movement
- Bee swarms finding food sources

**Applications:**

- Routing optimization
- Clustering
- Function optimization

## **2. Optimization**

### 2.1 What is Optimization?

**Optimization** is the process of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions for a given problem. It involves maximizing or minimizing an objective function while satisfying a set of constraints.

In real-world applications, optimization helps in making the most efficient use of available resources, reducing costs, maximizing profits, or improving performance. The goal is to find the optimal values of decision variables that produce the best outcome according to specified criteria.

**General Optimization Problem:**

```
Minimize/Maximize: f(x)    (objective function)
Subject to:        g(x) ≤ 0  (inequality constraints)
                   h(x) = 0  (equality constraints)
                   x ∈ S     (search space)
```

```
Ants finding shortest path to food:

1. Ants explore randomly
2. Leave pheromone trail
3. Shorter paths → more pheromone (faster return)
4. More ants follow stronger trails
5. Converges to shortest path

Optimization Analogy:
- Ants = candidate solutions
- Pheromone = solution quality
- Path = optimization problem
```

#### 2. Bird Flocking

```
Birds coordinating movement:

Rules:
1. Separation: Avoid crowding
2. Alignment: Match velocity of neighbors
3. Cohesion: Move toward center of flock

Result: Coordinated group movement

Optimization Analogy:
- Birds = particles
- Flock center = best solution
- Movement = search process
```

#### 3. Bee Foraging

```
Bees finding best flower patches:

1. Scout bees explore randomly
2. Return and perform waggle dance
3. Dance intensity ∝ food quality
4. More bees recruited to better patches
5. Optimal resource allocation

Optimization Analogy:
- Bees = search agents
- Food quality = objective function
- Dance = information sharing
```

### 6.1 What is Evolutionary Computation?

**Evolutionary Computation (EC)** is a family of optimization algorithms inspired by the principles of biological evolution. It mimics the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals survive and reproduce, passing their characteristics to the next generation.

EC uses mechanisms like selection, recombination (crossover), and mutation to evolve a population of candidate solutions toward better solutions over successive generations. This approach is particularly effective for complex optimization problems where traditional methods fail or are too slow.

### 6.2 Biological Evolution Principles

| Biological Concept | EC Equivalent         |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| **Individual**     | Candidate solution    |
| **Population**     | Set of solutions      |
| **Fitness**        | Solution quality      |
| **Chromosome**     | Encoded solution      |
| **Gene**           | Solution component    |
| **Selection**      | Choose best solutions |
| **Crossover**      | Combine solutions     |
| **Mutation**       | Random modification   |
| **Generation**     | Iteration             |

### 6.3 Evolutionary Computation Paradigm

This diagram shows how evolutionary algorithms work: they keep improving a group of solutions by repeating selection, crossover, and mutation until the best answer is found.
The process stops when a good enough solution is reached or after a set number of cycles.

### 6.4 Key Components of Evolutionary Algorithms

#### 1. Representation (Encoding)

**Binary Encoding:**

```
Solution: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Example: Knapsack problem (item selected = 1)
```

**Real-Value Encoding:**

```
Solution: [3.5, 2.1, 7.8, 4.2]
Example: Function optimization
```

**Permutation Encoding:**

```
Solution: [3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
Example: TSP (city visit order)
```

#### 2. Fitness Function

**Purpose:** Evaluates solution quality

**Example:**

```
Maximization problem: fitness = f(x)
Minimization problem: fitness = 1/f(x) or -f(x)
```

#### 3. Selection Methods

**a) Roulette Wheel Selection**

```
Probability of selection ∝ fitness
P(i) = fitness(i) / Σfitness(all)

Example:
Individual 1: fitness = 10, P = 10/30 = 33%
Individual 2: fitness = 15, P = 15/30 = 50%
Individual 3: fitness = 5,  P = 5/30  = 17%
```

**b) Tournament Selection**

```
1. Randomly select k individuals
2. Choose best among them
3. Repeat for each parent needed
```

**c) Rank-Based Selection**

```
Selection based on rank, not absolute fitness
Avoids premature convergence
```

#### 4. Crossover (Recombination)

**a) Single-Point Crossover**

```
Parent 1: [1 1 0 | 1 0 1 0]
Parent 2: [0 1 1 | 0 1 0 1]
          ────────┼──────────
Child 1:  [1 1 0 | 0 1 0 1]
Child 2:  [0 1 1 | 1 0 1 0]
```

**b) Two-Point Crossover**

```
Parent 1: [1 1 | 0 1 0 | 1 0]
Parent 2: [0 1 | 1 0 1 | 0 1]
          ─────┼───────┼─────
Child 1:  [1 1 | 1 0 1 | 1 0]
Child 2:  [0 1 | 0 1 0 | 0 1]
```

**c) Uniform Crossover**

```
Randomly select genes from each parent
Mask:     [1 0 1 0 1 1 0]
Parent 1: [1 1 0 1 0 1 0]
Parent 2: [0 1 1 0 1 0 1]
Child:    [1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
          (from P1 if mask=1, P2 if mask=0)
```

#### 5. Mutation

**a) Bit Flip Mutation (Binary)**

```
Before: [1 1 0 1 0 1 0]
After:  [1 1 0 0 0 1 0]  (4th bit flipped)
```

**b) Swap Mutation (Permutation)**

```
Before: [3 1 4 2 5]
After:  [3 5 4 2 1]  (positions 2 and 5 swapped)
```

**c) Gaussian Mutation (Real-valued)**

```
x' = x + N(0, σ)  (add Gaussian noise)
```

### 6.5 Types of Evolutionary Algorithms

#### 1. Genetic Algorithm (GA)

- Binary/integer encoding
- Fitness-proportionate selection
- Crossover + mutation
- Best for discrete problems

#### 2. Genetic Programming (GP)

- (μ, λ) or (μ + λ) selection
- Best for continuous optimization

#### 4. Differential Evolution (DE)

- Real-valued encoding
- Mutation: v = x₁ + F×(x₂ - x₃)
- Crossover with trial vector
- Best for numerical optimization

## **7. Swarm and Collective Intelligence**

> PYQ: What is swarm intelligence and why is it used? How does swarm intelligence work? What type of multi-agent learning is swarm intelligence? (2022-Feb, 7.5 marks)  
> PYQ: Explain swarm intelligence along with collective intelligence. (2024-May, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Write short notes on Swarm intelligence. (2024-May, 2.5 marks)  
> PYQ: Write short notes on Collective intelligence. (2022-Dec, 3 marks)

### 7.1 What is Swarm Intelligence?

**Swarm Intelligence (SI)** means smart group behavior that comes from many simple agents working together. It is inspired by the social behavior of insects and animals such as ants, bees, birds, and fish.

In swarm intelligence, each agent follows easy rules and interacts with others nearby. There is no leader or central control. By working together, the group can solve problems or act in smart ways that single agents cannot do alone.

### 7.2 Why Swarm Intelligence?

| Reason               | Description                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Robustness**       | System continues even if agents fail                 |
| **Flexibility**      | Adapts to changing environments                      |
| **Scalability**      | Works with any number of agents                      |
| **Simplicity**       | Simple individual rules, complex collective behavior |
| **Decentralization** | No single point of failure                           |

### 7.3 Principles of Swarm Intelligence

1. **Self-Organization**: Order emerges from local interactions
2. **Positive Feedback**: Amplifies good solutions
3. **Negative Feedback**: Dampens poor solutions
4. **Randomness**: Exploration of solution space
5. **Multiple Interactions**: Agents interact with each other and environment

### 7.4 Examples in Nature

| Example           | Behavior                           | Application          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Ant Colonies**  | Pheromone trails for shortest path | Routing algorithms   |
| **Bird Flocking** | Coordinated movement               | Traffic optimization |
| **Bee Swarms**    | Collective decision-making         | Resource allocation  |
| **Fish Schools**  | Predator avoidance                 | Sensor networks      |

## **8. Collective Intelligence**

### 8.1 Definition

**Collective Intelligence** is the smart results that come from many people or agents working together and sharing ideas. It goes beyond simple rule-following (like in swarms) and uses the knowledge, skills, and experience of each member to solve problems or make decisions that are hard for one person alone. Examples include Wikipedia, online forums, and group decision-making.

### 8.2 Collective Intelligence vs Swarm Intelligence

| Aspect            | Swarm Intelligence         | Collective Intelligence       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Agents**        | Simple, homogeneous        | Can be complex, heterogeneous |
| **Communication** | Indirect (stigmergy)       | Direct and indirect           |
| **Examples**      | Ants, bees, birds          | Human crowds, Wikipedia       |
| **Intelligence**  | Emergent from simple rules | Can involve reasoning         |

### 8.3 Applications

- **Crowdsourcing**: Wikipedia, open-source projects
- **Prediction Markets**: Collective forecasting
- **Social Networks**: Trend detection
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommendation systems
